This is my ICT notes. I started learn it in the end of 2023, but topic is quite big and complex.
ICT said that hist students should make a notes because its not realistic to keep everything in memory...

### February 15, 2023 ES Live Commentary AM Opening Session
[February 15, 2023 ES Live Commentary AM Opening Session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YSVu51hUWQ)

We should always look on multiple chArts: ES, NQ, YM, DXY. All markets should agree:
if Dollar is going higher, then we are looking for short setups on indexes (risk-off mode);
if Dollar is moving lower, then we are looking for longs on indexes (risk-on mode)

### February 15, 2023 ES Session Review
[February 15, 2023 ES Session Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSWN6YSVyFY)

NDOG (New Day Opening Gap) is price in between 5pm market close and 6pm market open its
a reference point where algorithm will refer and come back later.

The Bodies tell the story, the Wicks do the damage.

If we expect that market is going to be hard to read (for example due to high impact
news), we can trade on 7:00am-8:30am to utilize that interval during pre-market before
news driver (medium to high impact news) and expect that we can reach our target at 8:30am

Symmetrical market is when for example we have lower low in NQ and ES and higher high on DXY.
This is we want to see to trade, if at any time we see non-symmetrical market we want to step
away because of sentiment shift unfolding. Example: if we for example cannot see dollar
index higher high when it was expected - it's a dollar index divergence, and it's a signal
for  smart money, so they probably will seek for liquidity (external - Buyside or internal -
50% of dealer range, bearish gaps or blocks...)

Buy model on last hour macro 15:15-15:45 after stops (liquidity) has been taken is not a
Market Maker Buy Model is when market starts booking higher price until we get a pool of
liquidity (Buyside liquidity) or premium inefficiency (FVG SiBi)

Order Block it's a Change in the State of Delivery.
Order block start on opening price of consecutive sets of down close candles after its validation.
Order Block is valid as soon as upper close candle goes 1 tick above Order Block.
Order Block is fair value, it means that algorithm with offer that fair value to the Smart Money.

### February 16, 2023 ES Opening Session Commentary
[February 16, 2023 ES Opening Session Commentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXx07qzW5u0)

New Week Opening gap (NWOG) is gap between 16:00 on Fri and 18:00 on Sun.
New Week/Day Opening gap (NDOG) is gap between 16:00 and 18:00 of current.
Opening Range Gap (OR) is gap between yesterday's 16:00 closing price and today's 9:30 opening price.

If we had news drivers and big run before 9:30 then we can expect price choppiness and/or run agains
profitable traders (who was able to catch this move) stops. For example after bin market drop if we're
not going to go lower ask yourself "where is the money?" right, - higher buyside liquidity on bearish
inefficiencies, order blocks, or previous highs, or relative equals highs...

Breaker Block is: Low, Higher High, Lower Low, retrace to block and go higher.
Mitigation Block its almost opposite to Bullish Breaker Block: Low, Higher High, Higher Low, retrace
to block and go higher.

If we want to confirm that our Bullish Breaker Block invalid - price should at least go lower through
it and then back upper, so Breaker will act as resistance (similar to -iFVG).

[ICT February 24 - Conquering Fear Of Being Wrong Vs. Profitability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUYWVwyRhZs)

Market Structure Shift (MSS) is short term change in market sentiment and it will deliver on a short
term basis. MSS doesn't require close above a STH, its just need to trade above it.

Market Structure Break (MSB) is where entire trend in marketplace changes, and we're going into
longer higher timeframe delivery of the price (where if its bullish, and we have MSB that is bearish,
then we would say that is change in trend, aka reversal).

Once MSS occur algorithm will start a macro for price delivery.

Macro is a short list of instructions that algorithm will run in a price engine which creates these
fluctuations in price action, and it doesn't matter what buying and selling pressure currently is.

+SMTD is only confirmation tool that showing that Sellside Liquidity was taken, and we're going
higher if we are bullish.

You do not ever want to be trading ahead of CPI numbers, it will rip your face off.

When we're watching +OB, we are looking on its high and Mean Threshold and expecting a reaction higher
from it.

Bullish Propulsion Block its nested OB within another OB.

### February 25, 2023 Market Commentary
[February 25, 2023 Market Commentary](youtube.com/watch?v=kFIOp8Tprdc)

Before trading week routine:
![2023-02-25.jpeg](./2023-02-25.jpeg)
Here ðŸ‘† 
* 1 - +FVG (Bullish Fair Value Gap)
* 2 - Price retrace into this +FVG Consequent Encouragement (C.E.)
* 3 - +MSS (Market Structure Shift)
* 4 - Price retrace into +BB (Bullish Breaker)
* 5 - Price retrace into +OB (Bullish Order Block) which is candle with lower body
* 6 - Price retrace into +VI (Bullish Volume Imbalance)
* 7 - We expect price will reach +VI higher
* 8 - We also can expect that price should at least touch Equilibrium (50% or Dealer Range)
* 9 - Finally our expectations is that price can potentially reach -FVG (Bearish Fair Value Gap)

On a weekly charts each Saturday or Sunday we should anticipate where candle is likelihood should expand,
lower or higher? - This is our weekly bias. Benefit of doing this is our orientation for lower timeframe,
because we will know what we will expect from price, so we submit ourselves to believe that price should
go in our direction according to our biggest odds and our idea comes from weekly and daily charts...

HRL (days with lots of chop) vs LRL (days with big movement candles): We should learn when whey are occur
to focus on LRL for our trades.

When we see that price did big movement prior to 9:30 then we should expect that at lease NY.AM session
(but maybe and NY.PR) will be choppy. We gonna miss some moves and it's okay.

-BB (Bearish Breaker Block) can be treat if price was closed below Breaker down close candle, so even
if price did -MSS and has -FVG upper we should not expect that price will come back up to that -FVG, but
if we see -VI lower than -BB or -FVG, then we can expect that price will just touch -VI and drop lower.

Engineered Liquidity can be formed for example near old relative equals highs, when we are not swept it
and form -BB initial down move candles to make believe retail crowd that they must sell shorts, so on
next -BB upper move we will take their buy stops (break all short traders).

-IOFED is when market touched a little bit -FGV and drops.

In bearish market every time when market goes up it's returning to take buy stops or repricing
inefficiencies.

Wicks are inefficiencies, so we can expect price reach mid. point of these wicks (C.E.)

Dress your charts correctly.

We can use SMT not only with highly correlated markets but also USDX SMT. For example if ES made a higher
high and in according normal situation DXY should do lower low, when DXY wasn't able to make lower low it
is USDX SMT.

### March 06, 2023 Live Tape Reading \ Baseline 1 of 3
[March 06, 2023 Live Tape Reading \ Baseline 1 of 3](youtube.com/watch?v=n37ozsUreR0)

We're going to do wrong. So baseline measurement 1 of 3 Drawdown Mitigation & Rebuilding.

Do not trade on Non-Farm Payroll, Federal Funds Rate, FOMC, CPI, PMI, etc...
See: https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar

Opening Range (OR) it's 1st 30 minutes of trading (09:30-10:00) and we are not trading during this
period of time. We are wait for 09:50 macro to see how market will reach for liquidity or reprice
inefficiencies and when market will show his hand we can try to trade next hour NY.AM Silver Bullet
in between 10:00-11:00

On ORG if we see ES or NQ price is above it and making higher high, but Dollar Index is not confirming it
with lower low, then we might expect that price will pull back into this ORG

OR (09:30-10:00) it is not a ORG (17:00-09:30) or NDOG (17:00-18:00) or NWOG (Fri 17:00-Sun 18:00).

In HRL run conditions the market is in no hurry to get to an opposing discount or premium array. Because
liquidity or inefficiency is encapsulated be that idea. Where in environment like a LRL run it's in a hurry
very quickly to get where it wants to go (reach opposite premium or discount array).

In HRL run conditions market is no hurry to reach opposing PD Array (choppiness or consolidations...)
In LRL run conditions market is in a hurry to reach opposing PD Array (big candles or push-push-push...)

We should always take partial profit, or close a trade if there are only 1 contract to not allow us be
frustrated by think to being right and loose money instead of taking some money. Risk management is #1

If we're expecting price go higher, then down close candles should support price.  

SMT: If YM made a higher low, but ES or NQ made a lower low, then it's SMT Divergence.

### March 07, 2023 Live Tape Reading \ Fed Chair Testimony 10am
[March 07, 2023 Live Tape Reading \ Fed Chair Testimony 10am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu0sQarBRrI)

We should always think like so: if I would control market price, whe would I steer a price to and why?
So what we need to do is annotate on 5m and 15 m timeframes liquidity pools that hasn't been reached yet.
Its formation can be related to previous day or earlier... So SM, algo and those who controls price, they
will go where wouldn't be too much to expect to reach those lever with liquidity pool (too clean, too
smooth retail support/resistance levels, old lows/highs, FVGs, order blocks...)

When we annotated both (Sellside and Buyside Liquidity Pools) 2nd thing we will do - we can study and
watch which of these levels market will reach first

If market will take Buyside first, then we should see if it is going to reach opposite (Sellside) Liquidity
and vise versa...

It's not about be right or wrong! It's not yet about trade setup. We should view this as a personal
exercise in observation, so in that way we are not just looking at the chart blindly, not knowing what
we are paying attention to, what's relevant to us... It's just helps us with reading the tape and reading
the tape it's not about pushing a button, and it's not about trading... it's about observing price and
getting feel what it's doing right and that's experience chart times, it's how we train ourselves with
online charts price data

When we have price in between two NWOGs and it reaches mid. point, it's always reasonable to expect that
price can reach that NWOG its moving towards

We shouldn't regret if we did not catch some move. Big moves happens very often. This is a way of forging
of patience and self-control

We should be not afraid of using stop lose

If we see like DXY made a higher high, but ES not make a lower low then we can expect that ES should
eventually make lower low... But, if YM made lower low and ES is not (+SMT Divergence ES), then we can
expect short-term consolidation or even potential reversal

In other words, if we are in a position and for example YM is making a lower low, but ES with NQ is
not then we should take ofo more than half of our position, because it could mean it could create a
replacement higher against the position that would have open

If later after ES/DXY Divergence will be declined, meaning markets back to symmetrical behavior, than
we can assume that markets movement are in sync and we can expect normal, not unexpected

[March 08, 2023 Live Tape Reading \ Fed Chair Testimony 10am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H74nXabvL0)

Once we reach a weekly objectives we should stop.

The weeks of Non-Farm Payroll which is typically not always, but typically the first Friday of every month,
so we don't trade the day before, and we don't trade on that Friday because the probabilities for precision
fall off precipitously. So protocol for such Non-Farm Payroll weeks is next: our task as a trader is to get
all our business done on Wednesday NY.AM, once it's 11:00 - it's over, we are done

Inside us 3 people:
* analyst - person in charge of what we're going to be doing? Buying or selling?
* trader - the person who is going to be doing engagement itself with timing aspect when we are pushing
  the button, managing the risk, using the logic that being leaned on as the analyst
* gambler - this person we should keep out of driver seat and hold away from trading in these two days,
  because gambler is want to see what will happen if we will push the button

NWOG it's a true dynamic FVG. So market algorithm does is deliver price in it to offer fair value to
marketplace, not necessary for us, but for large funds and SM. Once price goes here large funds either
come in or get taken out

1) Market goes up for Buy-stops or re-deliver into inefficiency like FVG upper. That it: it's either going
   up for that reason for long to sell their long positions too, or it's going up to start a new sell-off
   so in that way shorts can be implemented, and then it's going to be looking for an opposing liquidity
2) Market goes down for Sell-stops that hold below an old low, or it will goes down for an inefficiency,
   or it's going lower to start new buys, so in that way longs can be implemented, and target objectives
   will be opposite Buyside Liquidity
3) If it's not doing that, guess what it's doing - it's consolidating. Usually consolidation is happening
   ahead of big news, so we don't trade in consolidation

When we Bullish then we are looking for 2 things: a) it's going up for Buy-stops - above a high or relative
equal highs, or b) it's going up for Premium Fair Value Gap - some kind of inefficiency where market has
dropped in a previous as far as 60 days back, some old high, some old price decline where is a FVG, it's
going up to that level to re-price. That's the only two reasons why price is going to go up

The market will where money is. If there are no money they will engineer it

### NWOG - New Week Opening Gap
[NWOG - New Week Opening Gap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKnlIIkBTk&list=PLVgHx4Z63pabpjlduWBaEsn8VMtALhjGV&index=39&pp=iAQB)

When analyzing NWOG, don't use daily charts, use something like 5m charts

Use Fri closing price.
Use Sun opening price.
And C.E. in between them

ICT NWOG it's a tool with is giving information on large funds fair value meaning the market will gyrate in
between current and previous NWOG

NWOG it a real liquidity void there is no trading there, so when market moves away from that after re-pricing
into it, it can refer back to it weeks ago, a month ago or more. So we need to keep at least of 5 of them on
our charts for proper perspective of large funds valuation

If we are moving around current and previous NWOG then we are in consolidation.
If in a trending days we are moving away from current NWOG then we might expect to get back to it later

There are two NWOGs, and we should prepare two templates in our TradingView for these gaps:
1. NWOG Actual, which is forming from Fri 16:69 closing price and Sun 18:00 opening price.
2. NWOG, which is forming from Fri 16:69 closing price and Mon 9:30 opening price.

By looking on a difference between these two NWOG and NWOG Actual we can learn how fair valuation is 
utilized during the week and/or even month

### Lecture On ICT Order Blocks & Tape Reading April 18, 2024
[Lecture On ICT Order Blocks & Tape Reading April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxR3tVRS_FI)

Bias must be found based on weekly and daily charts.
Don't build bias based on anything what less than 1 hour.

SM doing stop runs only to kick out everyone who can be profitable and
to catch traders who created limit orders for breakouts.

Seasonal tendency take price down into the spring decline.

In days when we have high impacted news we should use 5 minutes
timeframe to reduce choppiness and spottiness of price fluctuation.
In all other "normal" trading days we can use 1 minute and sub-minute
timeframes.
On high impact news drivers we should wait and use 5 minutes charts at
least 15-20-30 minutes and only then we can start dropping down below
5 minutes charts for looking for inefficiencies because we won't
probably pick a right one...

When I'm bullish, my stop loss should have 3 PD arrays above it or 
3 PD arrays below it when I'm bearish.

Dealer range is high that was engaged buyside and low that was engaged sellside.
And it must be on a timeframe we are looking for analysis (5 minutes on high
impact driver news during 15-30 minutes after release). Best moves starts from \
running stops, so if we are bearish - we want to see that market take buy stops
first.

Algorithm is designed to range wide to seek liquidity.

Important to keep in mind quadrants and remember that best entries when we are:
* bullish: in between 50%-100% of +OB or +FVG
* bearish: in between 0%-50% of -OB or -FVG

### How To Read Price With Or Without A Bias - April 29, 2024
[How To Read Price With Or Without A Bias - April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpdFdIckXqo)

Wicks == Gaps. Our focus on C.E. or upper quadrants if bullish (lower quadrants when bearish).

When we have high impact news, we are wait for damage and manipulation. Only then, after all retail
traders will be stopped out from their seats we are looking for turtle sups or other setups.

If there are no high impact news, then we can relay on macros (every single trading hour 20 minutes
macros): 9:50am-10:10am, 10:50am-11:10am, 1:50pm-2:10pm, 2:50pm-3:10pm and 3:15-3:45 last hour macro

If bullish and want to use +OB, then there should be only few down closed candles that we should use
only as opportunity to buy. If there are a lot of down closed candles, then we either on
consolidation or near to high, but definitely not in up move.

Same thing in relation to FVG, we don't want to see every FVG was fully rebalanced, we do want to
see price left some inefficiency stay opened, not fully closed, otherwise we maybe on end of the run

To capture nice day trades we need to look at 15m charts or 1h charts.
To capture nice swing trades we need to look at 1h charts or 4h charts.
To capture nice position trades we need to look at 1D charts or 1W charts.

Change in a state of delivery it's always opening price of OB. Delivery it's
directional price run, so it's going to be a change in the direction of price.

### Reading Price Without A Bias - April 30, 2024
[Reading Price Without A Bias - April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joqM_Z96vtM)

Do not trade on non-farm payroll week from after lunch Wed till Fri.
If we want we can trade 15-30 minutes after non-farm payroll numbers report.

Reclaimed FVG / Reclaimed OB is when initial expectations is used at later time.
IFGV / Mitigation block is when its reverse the role.

Bounce price range is when you have 2 inefficiencies (BiSi and SiBi) in opposing
directions in a same general area in terms of price. Best is with 1 candle in a
middle because it would be sudden and more impactful. Or it could be pattern called
island reversal. We can trade is as iFVG

### Keynotes & Observations - May 01, 2024
[Keynotes & Observations - May 01, 2024]()

In FOMC day is 2 stage event: 1) Move start on 14:00 and complete at 14:30 2) At 14:35
I can do either reversal or continue

Non-Farm Payroll is also nopt possible for trading - algorithm is turn off and manual
intervention will be turned on

How to detect time when LRL in place? If there are no news drivers.

Session bias can be built for 4h and 1h charts: were we are? where are we going from?
where are we going to (block, inefficiency, C.E, draw on liquidity etc...)?

Why we don't want Opening Range Gap fill completely if we are Bearish? Because if it
cannot fill that Gap it means that it Very Bearish.

We can expect as retail traders want to go short after big down day, so smart money
wants to trap them. Takeaway from this is: when retail public crowd want to sell,
smart money want to move markets higher to get everybody else Byu stops.

## Market Maker Series (2021)

* Central Banks - **are Maket Makers**
* Dealers like Chase, BofA, Citi or Goldman Suchs, etc - **are not Market Makers**
* Brokers like TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, etc - **are not Market Makers**

### Bias
To have an idea where is market is goling to go we need a Bias.
So how to get that Bias?

#### Quantitative Analysis (objective)
First of all we can make a Quantitative Analysis:
* Global Interest Rates on [global-rates.com](https://www.global-rates.com/en/interest-rates/central-banks/).
  Important here is: Interest Rates Differentials - which country you will choose to place your money? with 2% interest rates or with 5%?
  Obviously you will choose higher yield interest rates... Central Banks thinks similarly but with some differentials...
  So if USD or CAD interest rates are higher (0.25%) than for example JPY (Japaneese Yen) and COT (commercials) are
  Bullish on USD or CAD and Bearish on JPY, then we can anticipate rallie on USD/JPY and CAD/JPY currency pairs...
  And it's not just 1D Bias, it's long run
* Commitment Of Traders (COT) on [barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/futures/commitment-of-traders/).
  We are mostly interesting on commercials - Bullish is when COT commercials (Red color) indicator on a Asset is above
  zero, otherwise it's Bearish when COT commercials Red colored indicator line is below 0  

### Institutional Order Flow & Liquidity
When we know where market is going to go on a high level, we would likw to figureout where it's going to go next weak or days.
So how to get that information?

#### Qualitative Analysis (subjective)
* If Market price is going Higher - we can expect that it may draw on **Buystop Liquidiry** and then:
  * Continue go Higher to draw on Higher Buy Stops Liquidity (too clean, double tops, etc)
  * Continue go Higher to rebalance BISI FVG which was previously form Higher
  * Continue go Higher to make a Higher High
  * Do reversal to move Lower to draw on Sellstop Liquidity in nearest future
  * Or stay for consolidation
* If Market price is going Lower - we can expect that it may draw on **Sellstop Liquidiry** and then:
  * Continue go Lower to draw on Lower Sellstop Liquidity (too clean, double tops, etc)
  * Continue go Lower to rebalance SIBI FVG which was previously form Lower
  * Continue go Lower to make a Lower Low
  * Do reversal to move Higher to draw on Buystop Liquidity in nearest future
  * Or stay for consolidation

### Market Maker Buy Model (MMBM)

Possible Lows formations:
1) Regular: Low then Lower Low => +Breaker or 2) Only with SMT Divergence: Low then Higher Low => +OB / +FVG / +OTE
![ICT Market Maker Buy Model - Regular Low Type](./MM/MMBM-regular-low-type.png) ![ICT Market Maker Buy Model - SMT Low Type](./MM/MMBM-smt-low-type.png)

Model starts from **Short Term Consolidation** or **Short Term Trading Range** - when price is
staying in range some time. For example on a 15m TF it could be 5-10 candels (it's depends)

### Implementing Bullish Daily Bias

![ICT Directional Bullish Bias For Sculping](./directional-bias/directional-bullish-bias-1.png) ![Implementing Bullish Daily Bias](./directional-bias/directional-bullish-bias-2.png)

If we are **Bullish**, we are looking for **daily (1D) chart** and when we see **Daily Swing Low (DSL)** formaation - what we are lookibg
for is next:

* **DSL** occur **only after** previous **Swing Daily High (DSH)** was broken (like **Long Tearm High (LTH)** or **Short Tearm High (STH)**)
  when that happened:
* We are on a **Bullish Alert** and our focus is on **Last Candle High (Right Candle High)**, so we wanna see the high be traded
  through on next day or before that we want to see some retraisment
* Once next day does that - we know that next we will anticipate a **run on previous day high liquidity**

![MNQH2024 Bullish Chart](./directional-bias/directional-bullish-bias-3-MNQH2024.png)

### Implementing Bearish Daily Bias

![ICT Directional Bearish Bias For Sculping](./directional-bias/directional-bearish-bias-1.png) ![Implementing Bearish Daily Bias](./directional-bias/directional-bearish-bias-2.png)

If we are **Bearish**, we are looking for **1D chart** and when we see **DSH** formaation - what
we are lookibg for is next:

* **DSH** occur **only after** previous **DSL** was broken, when that happened:
* We are on a **Bearish Alert** and our focus is on **Last Candle Low (Right Candle Low)**, so we wanna see the low be traded
  through on next day or before that we want to see some retraisment
* Once next day does that - we know that next we will anticipate a **run on previous day low liquidity**

![MNQH2024 Bearish Chart](./directional-bias/directional-bearish-bias-3-MNQH2024.png)

### ICT Power Of 3 Concept

#### Bullish Daily Bias

When The Daily Bias Is Bullish:

* Confirm London session was **Bullish**
* Wait for 8am New York time to stalk a **Long Position**
* Between 8am - 9:30am New York time it may form
* After 8am New York time wait for **Retracement Lower**
* New York session will retrace from the SWH
* Ideally select retracements of at least 20 pips lower
* If no retracement of 20 pips forms by 10am - walk
* If it does form - enter on the 62% fib as it drops down
* Expect price to retest High of Day or a Previous Days High then Targets 1 & 2

![ICT Power Of 3 - Bullish Daily Bias figure](./PO3/PO3-bullish-0.png) ![ICT Power Of 3 - Bullish Daily Bias example](./PO3/PO3-bullish-1.png)

#### Bearish Daily Bias

When The Daily Bias Is Bearish:

* Confirm London session was **Bearish**
* Wait for 8am New York time to stalk a **Short Position**
* Between 8am - 9:30am New York time it should form
* After 8am New York time wait for **Retracement Higher**
* New York session will retrace from the SWL
* Ideally select retracements of at least 20 pips higher
* If no retracement of 20 pips forms by 10am - walk
* If it does form - enter on the 62% fib as it rallies up
* Expect price to retest Low of Day or a Previous Days Low then Targets 1 & 2

![ICT Power Of 3 - Bearish Daily Bias figure](./PO3/PO3-bearish-0.png) ![ICT Power Of 3 - Bearish Daily Bias example](./PO3/PO3-bearish-1.png)

### When to expect Reversals?

#### TL;DR
Higher Time Frame (HTF) will help you to understand that...

* When the Hourly Chart trades to an obvious Old High or Old Low that has shown a clear willingness to reverse Price
  before... this will likely repeat.
* Sometimes Price will not respect an Old High or Low and these generic Support and Resistance levels will give way
  and we never really know for sure
* It is far better to expect them to cause a reaction, than not to. There are plenty of moves and price swings
  between these Key HTF price points to never have to worry about them either!

![ICT Reversal](./reversal/reversal.png)

### Money Management

* While you develop and practice in your Demo Account - it is important to also implement strict Risk controls
* This is the only protection you have in this business and if you want to see what can be accomplished... you
  need to use sound Money Management
* Consider using 1% per setup and gradually working your way up to 2% if this meets your "Risk Tolerance". It
  is important not to try to swing for Home-runs or take larger Risks
* Over-leverage will impede your development and drastically decrease your chances of seeing responsible
  equity growth

# Notes...

## When professionals trade?
* In bearish market 70% of time high of the week will be formed on Tue or Wed
* In bullish market 70% of time low of the week will be formed on Mon or Tue
* Do not trade on Wensday, Thoursday and Friday leading up to Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) because ther are is going to be a lot of volatility 
* Monday and Tuesday
* Wensday will have big price move if on Tue price was consolidate

## Institutional Price Delivery Algorythm (IPTA)

General order in the daily range:
* Consolidation = Asia
* Expansion/Reversal = London (Normally makes the high or low of day)
* Consolidation = Pre-NY (5:00am â†’ 8:00am EST)
* Retracement = (8:00 â†’ 8.30am EST)
* Expansion = NY
* Reversal = NY
* Consolidation = Near/after market close

General order in the weekly range:
* Sunday Open = Consolidation
* Monday = Expansion/Reversal
* Tuesday = Reversal
* Wednesday = Consolidation
* Friday = Reversal/Retracement/Expansion

## [Seasonality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmeCWULSTHc&t=26s)
* **SMT Divergence** (Smart Money Technique Divergence) is showing a willingness to correct the correlation.
  Usually it happens
  - At 8:30
  - Around 9:30 when there are already been nice early run before 7:00 or 8:00
  - At news events beign released
  And if we have a bias then it's healpful: For example **we are bulish** and **NASDAQ did a lower low**
  but **E-MINI S&P 500 - a higher low**, then we shouldn't trade **NASDAQ**, but **S&P 500** because its not
  likely to go lower, but higher
* On a **daily timeframe** charts we are looking for **SMT divergence** between all these 3 Indexes:
  - NASDAQ
  - S&P 500
  - DOW
* **In spring in between Apr and May** we are looking for **Bearish SMT divergence** when one of these indexes
  will not be able to form higher high.
  Once that happened we are hunt for **ICT 2022 Mentorship Bearish Model**
* **In autumn (fall) in between 3rd week of Spe and 3rd week of Nov** we are looking for
  **Billush SMT divergence** when one of these indexes will not be able to form lower low.
  Once that happened we are hunt for **ICT 2022 Mentorship Bullish Model**
* Weekly bias. [On a weekly chart (preferably before week start) we should think of where weekly candle should go
  higher or lower](https://youtu.be/tmeCWULSTHc?si=Fs4jFaHgYEBTnhH1&t=983). It depends on FED how ots gonna rase
  interrest rate (Stock markets doesn't like that). If we are in a earching season, then there are a lot of
  valotility because of earnings. All this factors - are drivers to where is market is going to go, up or down to
  drawing a liquidity or deliver price effectively to some previously formed FVG. So the only thing we are looking
  for is a likly movement higher or lower based on a weekly candle
* Daily bias. [On a daily chart we are lookling for swing highs and swing lows to get your liquidity
  ](https://youtu.be/tmeCWULSTHc?si=HZNXc0wvjaIxyMHE&t=995). Major treading time to looking for reasons what makes
  market go higher or lower will be found on that TF (time frame). We wanna see every STL (short teram low) which
  is going to be a sell stops on a bearish bias or buy stops on a bulish bias. Market is always drawing one of
  these things:
  - its drawing to stops, which is liquidity, or
  - its running to [imbalance (FVG)](https://youtu.be/tmeCWULSTHc?si=ObTgBNA4WAAsjBCW&t=1064)

  be changed in a moment where market price is opened at 9:30am... If current price is opened above
  **ORG Settlement**, then we should change **ORG Settlement** to **ORG Low**, otherwise **ORG Settlement** must be
  changed to **ORG High** as far opening price is under the **RTH** previously closed price

* **Old High** or **Old Low** is a first nearest Swing High or Swing Low you can found going back on a chart starting
  from current candle. If there are any other importants like **Fair Value Gap** or **Volume Gap** on a chart exists
  near that Old High / Old Low, then we should watch our trade range in between that and current candles highs and lows
  current candle and candle with
* **Silver Bullet** (SB). 1-hour time interval where a **FVG** can be touched: 10am-11am, 1pm-2pm

  move in the end of the day. If you don't have a setup by 10 minutes to 4 then don't do anything. Usually setup should appear
  in between 15:15-15:45 little tiny small sweet spot where I'm looking for liquidity (above the marketplace if I'm bulish or
  below marketplace if I'm bearish) or if there is an imbalance (BISI if I'm bulish, SIBI if I'm bearish)

## Rules
* Before trade always check highs and lows marker could sweep above or below for **Stop Raid**:
  * Asian session in between 7pm-9pm
  * London session in between 2am-5am
  * New York session in between 7am-10am
  * And finally intrady just before 9:30am 
* Trade from Monday till Friday:
  * From 8:30am (or 9:30am depends on year time) till 12pm
  * From 1-1:30pm till 4-4:30pm
* Do not trade on Thursday and Friday in between 8am and 10am
* **FVG** with **OTE** is significant only if before it we traded into Sellside Liquidity or Buyside Liquidity meaning
  that is should be traded under Retail Trader idea of support level / double bottom or it should be traded above Retail
  trader idea of resistance level / double top / head and sholders, etc... 
* Every gap or inefficiency should be delivered (filled) with both up and down price actions. So if Buyside delivery (when
  marked goes up) occurred it reasonable expect that later Sellside delivery is also going to be done eventually
* In most cases in 8:30am when news are came out the first run whatever that direction is in price that is the fake
  move - that is a first stage delivery. The second stage is the opposite is whatever that is meaning we will see price
  do reversal.
  For example:
  
  ![Fake move on MNQZ2023 on Fri Oct 06 '23 at 8:30am](./MNQZ2023-Fri-Oct-06-at-8-30-am-1st-stage.png)
  Here everybody thinking: "okay, it's going to go lower" and it's crashes everyone that's already in long... And it did so
  in stunning fashion very quickly, which scares everyone in a marketplace, it terrifies them! ...Then the market does
  a second stage: what the 8:30am news sentiment shift caused everyone to think that it would keep going lower and keep
  going lower... They trapped them short, and then they run against the move that took place in the morning:
  
  ![SMT price delivery move on MNQZ2023 on Fri Oct 06 '23 at 9:00am](./MNQZ2023-Fri-Oct-06-at-9-00-am-2nd-stage.png)

## How to define Opening Range Settlement and Opening Range Gap

* Enable RTH
* Mark with horiszontal line prev. Friday close 16:14pm price - **Opening Range Settlement**
* As soon Market open 9:30am price appears then mark ractangle with consequent encouragement line from horizontal price
  to Market open 9:30am price. Consequent encouragement line - **Opening Range Gap**
* If Market open 9:30am price will be higher than Friday close 16:14pm price then **Opening Range Settlement** becomes
  **Opening Range Low**
* If Market open 9:30am price will be lower than Friday close 16:14pm price then **Opening Range Settlement** becomes
  **Opening Range High**
