* Do HTF analysis, do not rush, we can spend even hour to determine Draw On Liquidity (where the market is going
  to go).
  If we find that the market is respecting our PDArrays, after we understand what the market is going to do, then we
  define our targets.
  We can look at 6h, 4h, 2h and 1h TFs, because if we are trying to trade a session, we basically in session-term
  conditions, where we should close our trade at 11:00 or 11:30, so we don't necessary need put a lot of effort on
  a Daily and Weekly TFs every single day. We are really trying to determine where is the market is going to trade
  to in the next two to three hours...
  So if we're trading NYam session from 9:30 to noon, we are fascinating where the market is going to go in the next
  two hours
* So what we are looking for? Most of what we are looking are Gaps:
  * NWOGs/NDOGs: If the price is in the upper half, then we are bullish, otherwise we are bearish
  * FVGs: Before getting into the trade by using FVG, we should have obvious "Draw On Liquidity" where price can go
    into. If we don't have obvious targets, that FVG doesn't make a high-probability conditions. For example, if we
    see yesterday's REHs its very obvious target
