[ICT Forex Price Action Lesson : Trending Days](https://youtu.be/PBzd2u4AgbE)

Monday can be not a very good day for trade, but it can show us where the market is willing to go.
If we are bearish, the best days to sell shorts are Mon, Tue, and Wed.
Classic entry can be selling short in LO (sometimes in NYO) when the market creates a high of the day. 
Thu is also can be a trading day and sometimes Fri.
But usually Thu is great for reversals, usually on NYO in between 10:00 and 11:00.
Fri like Mon is usually not a very good trading days.
Ideally, if we are bearish, in between 00:00 and 12:00 whole PO3 should happen

If the Dollar Index is bearish, then we can buy EURUSD or GBPUSD.
If the Dollar Index is sideways, then we should be looking crosses, like EURGBP, if that is bullish then we know what
to trade: EURUSD.
If the Dollar Index is in swing, then crosses might be in consolidation

We're going to be mad when Mon and Tue, and Wed when we think its bearish, but they do not give us sell days.
We need to study when this occurs in reference of weekly chart and daily chart.
- Did we just run down to the old low and run through old low?
- Or we run down to the old and retrace? Sometimes it can retrace way more deper in premium, and the on following week
  we can expect a selling days on Mon, Tue and Wed of the following week
