## Setups to build Income
[2022 ICT Mentorship - Ends Series Part 4 of 4](https://youtu.be/SO3SJFNRim8)

- Trade 1 ES Contract (E-MINI S&P)
- Trade NY am session from 9:30 to 11:30 EST
- Trade NY pm session from 13:30 to 15:30 EST
- SL (Stop Loss) is always static: 4 points (handles, or 16 ticks)
- TP (Take Profile) is always 5.25 points (handles, or 21 ticks)
- The Monthly goal: $1000 before taxes
- Stalk setups on Previous Weeks Highs & Lows
- Stalk setups on Previous Days Highs & Lows
- Stalk setups on Previous Sessions Highs & Lows
- All setups should be inexpected range expansion on a Weekly candle for the present week of trading

## Previous Week Highs
- When Weekly Candle for the present week of trading is likely to expand Lower, we hunt Short opportunities
- We wait for the Market to reprice above the PWH (Previous Week's High) and then we move to the 5-, 4-, 3-, 2- or
  1-minute charts for setup formation
- Use ICT Mentorship 2022 model for entry
- The repricing ES above PWH is expected to see Raid of the BSL (Buyside Liquidity)
- We are not trying to anticipate a reversal
- We are not going Short right it's going above PWH
- We are waiting for the market is tipping its hand to us
- If there is a Displacement leg Lower in price, we look for a SiBi in the displacement swing: there should be STL
  (Short-Term little swing Low) on lower timeframe that is breaks
- We will be looking at that price swing as a displacement swing, and we will be hunting in that displacement swing a
  FVG at or just above the equilibrium of that displacement swing. So if during AM or PM session price drives above
  PWH, and then breaks lower back below that PWH and causes a Bearish Short-Term Market Shift, because there is a Swing
  Low that was taken out. Then we are looking for a FVG at Equilibrium or Higher in the Displacement Leg or Price Swing,
  that made a High above that PWH, but then trades back down below it and through a Short-Term Swing Low. All that will
  signal an MSS (Market Structure Shift) that is now Bearish
- Once we see that, we drop down from 5 to 4, 3, 2 and 1-minute charts to refine and select a FVG that permits 4 points
  SL
- If no FVG that allows 4 point SL, we do nothing. We do not force higher Risk just to take a trade

## Previous Week Lows
- When Weekly Candle for the present week of trading is likely to expand Higher, we hunt Long opportunities
- We wait for the Market to reprice below the PWL (Previous Week's Low) and then we move to the 5-, 4-, 3-, 2- or
  1-minute charts for setup formation
- Use ICT Mentorship 2022 model for entry
- The repricing ES below PWL is expected to see Raid of the SSL (Sellside Liquidity)
- We are not trying to anticipate a reversal
- We are not going Long right it's going below PWL
- We are waiting for the market is tipping its hand to us
- If there is a Displacement leg Higher in price, we look for a BiSi in the displacement swing: there should be STH
  (Short-Term High) on lower timeframe that is breaks
- We will be looking at that price swing as a displacement swing, and we will be hunting in that displacement swing a
  FVG at or just below the equilibrium of that displacement swing. So if during AM or PM session price drives below
  PWL, and then shifts back higher that PWL and causes a Bullish Short-Term Market Shift, because there is a Swing
  High that was taken out. Then we are looking for a FVG at Equilibrium or Lower in the Displacement Leg or Price Swing,
  that made a Low below that PWL, but then trades back up above it and through a Short-Term Swing High. All that will
  signal a Market Structure Shift that is now Bullish
- Once we see that, we drop down from 5 to 4, 3, 2 and 1-minute charts to refine and select a FVG that permits 4 points
  SL
- If no FVG that allows 4 point SL, we do nothing. We do not force higher Risk just to take a trade

## Previous Day Highs
- When Weekly Candle for the present week of trading is likely to expand Lower, we hunt Short opportunities
- We wait for the Market to reprice above the PDH (Previous Day's High) and then we move to the 5-, 4-, 3-, 2- or
  1-minute charts for setup formation
- Use ICT Mentorship 2022 model for entry
- The repricing ES above PDH is expected to see Raid of the BSL
- We are not trying to anticipate a reversal
- We are not going Short right it's going above PDH
- We are waiting for the market is tipping its hand to us
- If there is a Displacement leg Lower in price, we look for a SiBi in the displacement swing: there should be STL
  (Short-Term Low) on lower timeframe that is breaks
- We will be looking at that price swing as a displacement swing, and we will be hunting in that displacement swing a
  FVG at or just above the equilibrium of that displacement swing. So if during AM or PM session price drives above
  PDH, and then breaks lower back below that PDH and causes a Bearish Short-Term Market Shift, because there is a Swing
  Low that was taken out. Then we are looking for a FVG at Equilibrium or Higher in the Displacement Leg or Price Swing,
  that made a High above that PDH, but then trades back down below it and through a Short-Term Swing Low. All that will
  signal a Market Structure Shift that is now Bearish
- Once we see that, we drop down from 5 to 4, 3, 2 and 1-minute charts to refine and select a FVG that permits 4 points
  SL
- If no FVG that allows 4 point SL, we do nothing. We do not force higher Risk just to take a trade

## Previous Day Lows
- When Weekly Candle for the present week of trading is likely to expand Higher, we hunt Long opportunities
- We wait for the Market to reprice below the PDL (Previous Day's Low) and then we move to the 5-, 4-, 3-, 2- or
  1-minute charts for setup formation
- Use ICT Mentorship 2022 model for entry
- The repricing ES below PDL is expected to see Raid of the SSL
- We are not trying to anticipate a reversal
- We are not going Long right it's going below PDL
- We are waiting for the market is tipping its hand to us
- If there is a Displacement leg Higher in price, we look for a BiSi in the displacement swing: there should be STH
  (Short-Term High) on lower timeframe that is breaks
- We will be looking at that price swing as a displacement swing, and we will be hunting in that displacement swing a
  FVG at or just below the equilibrium of that displacement swing. So if during AM or PM session price drives below
  PDL, and then shifts back higher that PDL and causes a Bullish Short-Term Market Shift, because there is a Swing
  High that was taken out. Then we are looking for a FVG at Equilibrium or Lower in the Displacement Leg or Price Swing,
  that made a Low below that PDL, but then trades back up above it and through a Short-Term Swing High. All that will
  signal a Market Structure Shift that is now Bullish
- Once we see that, we drop down from 5 to 4, 3, 2 and 1-minute charts to refine and select a FVG that permits 4 points
  SL
- If no FVG that allows 4 point SL, we do nothing. We do not force higher Risk just to take a trade

## Previous Session Highs
- When Weekly Candle for the present week of trading is likely to expand Lower, we hunt Short opportunities
- We wait for the Market to reprice above the PSH (Previous Sessions High) and then we move to the 5-, 4-, 3-, 2- or
  1-minute charts for setup formation
- Now, what is PSH? That can be either High that forming in between 8:30 and 9:30 on 5- or 15-minute charts in the
  middle of key opening times. So if we are looking for the Highest High in between these two times, that can be a run
  for BSL
- We also can look at a London Open session and see if we have taken London Open Session High formed in between 2:00
  and 3:00
- And if we are treading NY Close (NY pm) session, then PSH could be a NY Open Session high, or NY Lunch Session High,
  so Price may run above those highs as well. NY Close Session can be a continuation after running out BSL above the
  NY Lunch time hour Highs
- Use ICT Mentorship 2022 model for entry
- The repricing ES above PSH is expected to see Raid of the BSL
- We are not trying to anticipate a reversal
- We are not going Short right it's going above PSH
- We are waiting for the market is tipping its hand to us
- If there is a Displacement leg Lower in price, we look for a SiBi in the displacement swing: there should be STL
  (Short-Term Low) on lower timeframe that is breaks
- Once we see that, we drop down from 5 to 4, 3, 2 and 1-minute charts to refine and select a FVG that permits 4 points
  SL
- If no FVG that allows 4 point SL, we do nothing. We do not force higher Risk just to take a trade

## Previous Session Lows
- When Weekly Candle for the present week of trading is likely to expand Higher, we hunt Long opportunities
- We wait for the Market to reprice below the PSL (Previous Session Low) and then we move to the 5-, 4-, 3-, 2- or
  1-minute charts for setup formation
- Now, what is PSL? That can be either Low that forming in between 8:30 and 9:30 on 5- or 15-minute charts in the
  middle of key opening times. So if we are looking for the Lowest Low in between these two times, that can be a run
  for SSL
- We also can look at a London Open session and see if we have taken London Open Session Low formed in between 2:00
  and 3:00
- And if we are treading NY Close (NY pm) session, then PSL could be a NY Open Session Low, or NY Lunch Session Low,
  so Price may run below those lows as well. NY Close Session can be a continuation after running out SSL below the
  NY Lunch time hour Lows
- Use ICT Mentorship 2022 model for entry
- The repricing ES below PSL is expected to see Raid of the SSL
- We are not trying to anticipate a reversal
- We are not going Long right it's going below PSL
- We are waiting for the market is tipping its hand to us
- If there is a Displacement leg Higher in price, we look for a BiSi in the displacement swing: there should be STH
  (Short-Term High) on lower timeframe that is shifted higher
- Once we see that, we drop down from 5 to 4, 3, 2 and 1-minute charts to refine and select a FVG that permits 4 points
  SL
- If no FVG that allows 4 point SL, we do nothing. We do not force higher Risk just to take a trade

## Keeping Liquidity in Focus
- When we are stalking Shorts
  - We are essentially looking to engage Price after a Raid in BSL
  - The best think we can have before we go Short is to see if BSL was taken
  - Once stops was raided, it sets the likelihood for a displacement lower, because there are no Buy Stops anymore,
    and next what is logical to do is to take a Sell Stops...
  - If that Displacement Lower occurs, and we have Bearish MSS with FVG formed, the likelihood that we are on the right
    side with all these conditions is increasing because the opposite side of Liquidity was taken out
  - One of the precursors for a good Short: wa want to see how important High was taken out, or at least it goes above it
    and then it was quickly rejected
  - After a significant Short setup has formed, and the Draw On Liquidity has yet to be reached... Any new FVG on 1-minute
    chart can be used for a Short if a FVG on 1-minute chart is at or less than 5 handles. Most FVG will not completely
    close in on redelivery of price. the Gateway Gap (Breakaway Gap). What does it means? Let's assume we are Bearish,
    and we expect Weekly Candle to expand Lower ...and we are in the AM session: Market taken out BSL and we missed that
    ideal entry. If that FVG was formed on 5-minute chart or 3-minute chart... So we should drop down into 1-minute chart
    and wait a FVG to form
  - Buy focusing on FVGs that have 5 points or fewer wide on a 1-minute chart as long as the Draw On Liquidity isn't yet
    taken, then 1-minute FCG is always should be taken into consideration. ICT very often pyramiding using that very logic
  - What if we were stopped out? Let's assume it for the moment that Buyside has been taken, we are expecting the Weekly
    range to drop Lower, so we are Bullish... So our Bias is Bearish, and then we sell a FVG, and it stopped us out in 4
    points: We want to immediately use a low of that FVG, wait for price to trade below that, and if it comes back up and
    touches it again, that is our entry. Use 4 points SL again and if it stopped out us again: stop trading for that week.
    Don't take another trade, because: 1) we need a time to decompress; 2) if we have another loss, in total it will be
    three loosing trades for a one week, and it's not good
- When we are stalking Longs
  - We are essentially looking to engage Price after a Raid in SSL
  - The best think we can have before we go Long is to see if SSL was taken
  - Once stops was raided, it sets the likelihood for a displacement higher, because there are no Buy Stops anymore,
    and next what is logical to do is to take a Buy Stops...
  - If that Displacement Higher occurs, and we have Bullish MSS with FVG formed, the likelihood that we are on the right
    side with all these conditions is increasing because the opposite side of Liquidity was taken out
  - One of the precursors for a good Long: wa want to see how important Low was taken out, or at least it goes below it
    and then it was quickly rejected
  - After a significant Long setup has formed, and the Draw On Liquidity has yet to be reached... Any new FVG on 1-minute
    chart can be used for a Long if a FVG on 1-minute chart is at or less than 5 handles. Most FVG will not completely
    close in on redelivery of price. the Gateway Gap (Breakaway Gap). What does it means? Let's assume we are Bullish,
    and we expect Weekly Candle to expand Higher ...and we are in the AM session: Market taken out SSL and we missed that
    ideal entry. If that FVG was formed on 5-minute chart or 3-minute chart... So we should drop down into 1-minute chart
    and wait a FVG to form

    range to expand Higher, so we are Bullish... So our Bias is Bullish and then we buy a FVG, and it stopped us out in 4
    points: We want to immediately use a high of that FVG, wait for price to trade above that, and if it comes back down
    and touches it again, that is our entry. Use 4 points SL again and if it stopped out us again: stop trading for that
    week. Don't take another trade, because: 1) we need a time to decompress; 2) if we will have another loss, in total
    it will be 3 loosing trades for a one week, and it's not good
- Wht if our FVG is more than 5 handles? Let's assume it 7.5 handles wide: In this case, we can use the middle of the
  Gap, and then 4 handles SL will be enouth to allow that FVG be fully closed and not stopp us out
- We want to keep everything light: frequency and intensity. We have one trade per week. If we win, then stop for the
  week. If we lose, then we have one opportunity to retry. If we lose again, then stop for the week
- This is not a competition, this is about making ends meet. Our goal is to make a 5 points ($250) per week in one
  account. Once we're done, we don't trade this account. We want to pay a one monthly bill after one month of trading
  of that account

## News
- We should check the economic calendar and understand when big move can happen
- We should not to trade before or at time of the news release. We should wait for 15020 minutes after news is released
  and only then look for setups

## Prepare yourself
- Be ready to have patience. Wait for proper setup that afforst 4 point SL and 5.25 points TP on a single ES contract
- Be ready to miss many entries. When FVG is larger than 5 points, you may not get filled on a C.E
- Before your trading week begins, remind yourself that ypu are not expected to be in every possible trade idea or
  Price Swin
- Permit yourself to let most of the moves pass you by over the trading week
- If it doesn't offer it to you, you are not upset, you are not to fear missing a setup or price run
- You are focus on 5.25 points trade to make $250 one time per week
- If previous week you missed finding a setup, you permitted looking for 2nd setup on the following week if there are
  medium or high new drivers and Bias and everything else. But as soon we have two trades, we stop for the week

## Backtesting and Journaling
- Its absolutely necessary to do backtesting and journaling what setups we found.
- Its absolutely necessary to tape reading and watch live how setups are forming when it's booking price real time or
  by using TradingView Market Replay
- Then next necessary step to demoing it for 6 months
- And only then we can trade live funds account or prop firm funded account...
