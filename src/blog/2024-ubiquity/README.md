### ICT on the Christmas Rally (Quarterly Shifts)
Understanding the Market Structure and the Shifts Quarterly.

Trade with a tendency in mind:
- Between Aprilâ€“May down into June until fall months: we want to be focusing going short Stock Indices.
  The bigger moves will be on a Sellside. Time of the day: 70% in London Open we will see high of the day
  formed... So:
  - We are waiting for Buyside Liquidity was taken
  - Then should be a Shift of the Market Structure
  - Wait for -FVG was form
  - Sell short into that FVG
  - Hold it minimum to NY Open and see if NY is giving you a continuation where we can pyramid
  - Buy low / Sell high and hold for the daily range: it's a day-trading. Anything less than that it's
    intraday-trading, so we can break it into session swing:
    - trading London session (2am-5am) and close trade before 5am
    - trading NY am session (8:30am-11am)
    - trading NY pm session (1:30pm-4pm)
- Going long into fall until December.
- Do not push it hard in a summer because its doldrums (depression) on the market. Use the lowest leverage
  because it can be choppy and messy.

TODO: Backtest it for as many years as we have!

Market Profiles:
- Weekly profiles
- Daily profiles
  - **Consolidation day**: High of the day in London and consolidation for the rest of the day in NY session
  - **Classic Sell day**: High of the day in London and the sell off all day long and close somewhere close to the low
  - **Classic Buy day**: Creates the low in London and the rallies all throughout the day and the close near to high of
    that day
  - **Seek and destroy**: when it looks like a perfect trading opportunity, and then it starts chopping back and forth.
    It will go higher high, then lower low, then again higher high, and again lower low... and suddenly at the end of
    the day it takes off and just blows out one other range. Nobody allowed making money that day...
    When will it happen?
    - It's going to be right before a big, like FOMC day
    - It's going to be right before a rate announcement type thing
    - Some kind of high impact news
