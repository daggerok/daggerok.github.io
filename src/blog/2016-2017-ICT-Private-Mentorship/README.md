## ICT Forex Scout Sniper Basic Field Guide Series
[ICT Forex Scout Sniper Basic Field Guide Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qstxYesCTQk&list=PLVgHx4Z63paZuvcenUdDQejrBV8iVOhq8&index=1&ab_channel=TheInnerCircleTrader)

We should find a directional bias on HTF and trade in that direction

We should trade in a specific time of day when price can move significantly. To do so correctly, we should
analyze the price and see when big price moves are happened in the past. FOr example, in a bearish market,
we can make all highs after which price sharply dropped lower and check if this time of day its Killzone
(KZ), or maybe Silverbullet (SB)

In bearish market (if the daily chart is poised to move lower) we have a 70% of chance high of the week
forming by the London Open on Tuesday. Sometimes, Wednesday can take a high of Tuesday London Open high
during for example, some wild news and that is can be non-profitable trade if we haven't taken partials...
Sometimes the high of the week can be formed on Monday...

If it's a bullish week, we can expect parice will trade lower on Monday or Tuesday, so we can try to find
an entry into a trade on a specific levels

We should not get into a trade if we have no key resistance/support on HFT (1D, 4h, 1h)

When the market is doing high or low on a daily chart, these Hs and Ls are significant

Major reaction levels occur on yearly Hs and Ls; Quarterly Hs and Ls (every three months, for example, in a
block of Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep and Oct-Dec, will be significant Hs and Ls); Monthly Hs and Ls; Weekly
Hs and Ls; Intra-week Hs and Ls (for example, if on Wed we have highes hi or lowest low – that one may be
a influential); standard Daily Hs and Ls

Remember to focus on a Swing Hs and Ls, these Hs and Ls are very-very strong. We should annotate all three
candles of that swing H or L. For example, whenever we have a swing high formed on a daily chart, we should
mark H&L of all three candles of that swing H.

We do not look for a trade in LTF, unless it is trading at the HTF support/resistence levels. That means
that trade should be formulated around HTF level that we already marked from a daily and/or from 4h TF

When there are a lot of uncertainties, or some global events are happening: war, terrorist attack, etc... we should:
- reduce our leverage
- slow down our expectations

When we start new week, we can try to use Fri range

When we see three indians pattern, which is going into the old high, it might be significant.
We should see if there will be a brake lower, if it is, then we may go short with a high probability setup right after
reversal

### 10-year T-Notes, Yields

When the 10-year T-Note futures contract (Bond) is rallying, Dollar rallying sd wel, then the 10-year Yield for that
10-year T-Note would be declining, as well as foreign currencies.
And vise versa: when the 10-year T-Note futures contract (Bonds) is dropping, that means that 10-year Yield will be
going higher, Dollar bearish and Foreign currencies bullish

If we want to be a buyer of the currency (for example, EUR/USD), we should do that when the 10-year Bond Yield is
growing (i.e.: 10-year T-Note is dropping).
That means, as 10-year Bond Yield is going higher, the countries will chase that, because currencies are moving in the
same direction with 10-year Bond Yield.
That means, while 10-year T-Note is trading lower on HTF, should be buyer of currencies on that HTF

When we want to risk Max of our allowed leverage (depends on us what these numbers are):
- For Long trades, we can risk more than for Short trades if the 10-year Bond Yield is rallying higher
- For Short trades, we can risk more than for Long trades if the 10-year Bond Yield is dropping lower
- It doesn't means that we cannot see a counter-moves to what we expect, no, we will see how currencies are dropping
  lower even if 10-year Bond Yield is moving higher ...and we can trade short on such retracements based on HTF
  analysis... but we will use less leverage for shorts, while if we see a bullish market structure, we can trade with
  our maximum allowed leverage, because Long trades will be agreed with our 10-year Bond Yield HTF analysis

### Power of three

When there is a small inside day (not Sunday, this one should be ignored completely), then we can expect that next day
or two real big move will happen.
We want to trade inside a consolidations when the market is boring...
And when a big and explosive move happens, we hopefully will be in position, and the market hopefully will be moving in
our favor, and its duration can be 1 day or 2 days or even three days

On large-range days, the open tends to be at the opposite extreme of the daily range opposed to the close.
Meaning if it's a big bullish-range day, then open of that day will be lower than close and vise versa: if it's a big
bearish-range day, then open will be near to the high, while close will be near to the low

Also on a such big-range days, price usually not staying very long time, it will probably take some stops or quickly
reprice to some key level and then quickly move in its real direction. It means, that wo we should follow when to get
into a trade and our goal is to catch the whole daily move.

TODO: Backtest this:
We should hunt to catch a power of three daily range moves in between midnight and 2pm.
Usually we can see some king of manipulation and then move towards our targets and objectives.
If this is going to be a big bullish day, then after midnight in London Open we can see some kind of manipulation with
a fake move below the midnight opening price. Then NY Open can be a continuation up to NY Close. From NY Lunch price
most likely will not be moving until Asia...

### Killzones (EST)
- Europe (Hunt Directional Bias):
    - 02:00am-11:00am Frankfurt
    - 03:00am-12:00pm London
      - London Open: 01:00am-05:00am
- America:
    - 08:00am-17:00pm NY
      - NY Open: 07:00am-10:00am
    - 09:00am-18:00pm Chicago
- Asia (accumulation):
    - 19:00pm-04:00am Tokyo
    - 20:00pm-05:00am Hong Kong
- Pacific (accumulation):
    - 17:00pm-02:00am Sydney
    - 17:00pm-01:00am Wellington

#### Frankfurt
The hunt starts at 02:00am, because the close outcry is at 14:00pm.
Hunt the move that sets the H or the L of the day.
Trade Directional bias

#### London
Frankfurt hunt trade will be closing into London Close or before 14:00pm no matter if we were right on a directional
bias.
If we are not in the position before 05:00am, we close our charts and go to sleep until NY Open, somewhere before
07:00am (for example, at 06:30am we can check charts what is going on...)
Many times the move starts about 07:00am. Or in between 07:00am and 07:30am, because open outcry is starts at 07:20

### Sessions Hs and Ls
TODO: Backtest this: With the help of marking London H and L, later, we can in NY Open session use OTE for continuation

### Market Make Business Models

#### Market Make Buy Models
We can participate on a move lower right after the consolidation phase, when price trade lower and then come back to
low of the initial consolidation or even higher (OTE)

We should not trade and catch the low until we get confirmation that it was a reversal.
Confirmation can come in form of Market Struncture ShiftL MSS or Brake of Market Structure after a reversal pattern has
been formed around some support level or after liquidity is taken.
Many times the price will back and test reversal as support and give a buying opportunity on accumulation phase

We also can get into the trade in optional re-accumulation phase (which may not occur) if we are still in discount

#### Market Make Sell Models
Same thing as for Market Maker Buy Model, but in reverse:

We always start from consolidation.
When move out from consolidation, the H of that consolidation usually can be retested (but its optional and doesn't
always have to happen)

Then price will rally up to clearly defined liquidity (resistance) with reversal formation

Many times we will see how price leaving reversal and come back to re-test reversal low (optional)

Price will not stay long in reversal, usually it happens fast, so we should sell in re-accumulation phase(s)

### Tracking Institutional Price Action
As we know, when 10-year T-Note Yields (Bonds) are moving higher on HTF, Foreign Currency price will chase ("seek")
Yields.
So when the 10-Year T-Note Futures Market (Bonds) is going lower, that means that Yields will be moving higher and all
Currencies will be chasing that as well.
Meaning it will be Bullish for Currencies and Bearish for the US Dollar.
And vise versa, if 10-Year T-Notes (or Bonds) are rallying on a Futures Market, then that is going to decline Yields,
and it will be Bullish for the US Dollar and Bearish for Foreign Currencies

Next ICT showed how during ICT Killzones (KZs) we can use Optimal Trade Entry (OTE).
We should see in these specific time intervals (KZs) where market can pull back to enter a trade with specific premise
in mind that market is going higher because its chasing yields

So, this is how we can formulate our idea for Directional Bias.
It doesn't mean that we will always be buy if Yields are rallying...
We will be waiting for Bullish setups more and use higher leverage for Bullish ideas than for Bearish

TODO: Backtest this:
We should clearly see how the Market is moving during ICT KZs.
So if we are Bullish, and we trade either London Open or NY Open, then we wait for retracement during these KZs and we
are buying by using OTE

ICT showed that it's important to have annotated London Open and NY Open sessions highs and lows, and also highs and
lows inside sessions, because they can be used later on retracements as an OTE entry as support/resistance

Pause in between London and NY can be treated as NY Lunch

### Hidden OTE
When we see a prior big range move, next what we could expect us small range

When we see how RELs were taken with a big NWOG, we can use those REHs as a resistence level and expect that price
might not be trading lower and closing fully that gap right-away...
So as opportunity for entry OTC low can use those REHs

We should not pick a tops or lows, we should always wait for MSS

ICT highlighted how KZs are important

Before we get into a trade, we should exactly know:
- When? KZs
- Why? Directional Bias
- How? OTE

When we see these KZs, we should learn to expect some moves and journal them

### Directional Bias: Why Do Markets Move?
What are catalysts for markets moves?

ICT showed how Moving Average indicators 9 and 18 could be used for Directional Bias.
It's just a simplified way to read Market Structure.
Of course, we should read it from Price Actions, but in the beginning we can use HTF charts with Moving Averages

### Long Term Trends
ICT tells what his tools to read institutional order flow is independent to the markets and doesn't require any
indicators

What makes trades high-probability?
It's simply a combination of multiple things:
- It's in sync with HTF Market charts and current Market environment:
    - It's Risk-On or Risk-Off?
    - Is it moving in the same direction as HTF?
    - Is it moving in accordance with yields?
- Displacements: Are we in agree with large player displacements?

### ICT no-Brainer Directional Bias
Displacements and HTF charts sync

### Candlestick patterns
It's pausing

We need institutional sponsorship.
Institutional trading it's building up position in consolidation.
When we see move up and then consolidation, then we can expect the next move up relatively the same if measure from a
consolidation (low) level: 1STDV

If the price comes back to key-level support / resistance, run stops and fail to keep going, then it's in general
telling us that it was stop raid and price will do major repricing in the opposite direction.
For example, when we have the +OB and price rallied, then com back, run stops and fail to go lower, it's a sign that
now with high probability it will go higher

We should buy on down candles. And we should sell on bullish candle

When we see +MSS, we are looking for the first down-candle prior to this move up, and this candle with the overall
bullish directional bias will be our +OB

### ICT OTE Pattern
When the market is moving higher and later price comes back, we can find our +OB as a very first bearish candle prior
to that move higher and wait for OTE at point of (origin) interest (POI).
We should always enter below Asia high, and even better below Asia low

For the weekly range, if we are bullish: we are expecting to see a weekly low from Monday London Open to Wednesday
London Open max. If Low hasn't been formed, then our idea is probably wrong

Stop Loss (SL) should be placed below second swing low on a 15 m TF - 10-15 pips if we are bullish.
Trail SL like so: move it into break-even when the first target hit and then wait for the second target

Daily and 4h charts should be agreed. If we see move opposing our directional bias, then we don't trade

We are looking for quick and sudden move in price and then wait for retracement into OB + some institutional level

Weekly and Monthly charts are also beneficial. We shouldn't look on them every single day, but we have to look at them
from time to time...

The Last three daily, last three weekly and last three monthly highs and lows are beneficial to have on our charts,
because these levels could be sensitive

Look on the charts with weekly perspective is great with 1h chart

If we are bullish, we're hunting Long setups from Mon to Wed, typically weekly low should be established in that period
and vise versa for shorts

We are not looking for trade every day, we are looking for on shot one kill setup per week consistently (that is should
be our goal)

Annotate Asia high and low each day

Look for the daily high to form in Sell Models during London Open session.
If we are bearish, we're generally looking for daily high to form during the London Open, so at this time we can form
our sell positions.
And vise versa for Buy Models

Typically high or low of the day will be formed by sharp counter-trend direction on that day (Judas Swing). It's a
false move initially to fake everyone out and then quickly rejects and go in another way

We should hunt and stack our setups by combining time and price theory: hunt inside KZs and within large OBs, found on
60-minute, 4-hour and daily TFs

Opposite high or low of daily candle usually forming during London Close (from 11:00am to 12:00pm)

Most of the time NY Open its continuation of London Open, so if we were stopped out in London Open, we can re-entry
on NY Open

Sometimes NY Open can produce reversals, so we should look on Key levels of support/resistance for these purposes

Focus on 60-minute TF for price reactions for ideal risk/reward trades (1/3)

* Executing Top-Down analysis

### Tracking countries interest rates (IRs)
Currencies trend long term based on IRs

Which currency has higher IRs giving us directional bias for stronger currency.
If country has lower IRs, this currency is weaker

### Seasonal tendency (ST)
Commodity market is very forecastle by ST

GBP ST:
- Major low can be made in Feb – March, Jun, Sep – Oct and Dec
- Major high in Apr – May

this is also seen in stocks as well

If currencies go down, then Bond futures market is go up (Yield is inverted and go down):
Bond ST:
- Going up from Apr to May, that means that IRs will go down, and that means currencies lower and that means dollar
  rally (Risk Off)
- Bond sideways in between Jan and Feb, and then going down into April-May, that means that IRs increasing and that
  means Risk-On, dollar lower

### COT
We should be looking on a HTF (weekly charts) and on large commercial traders positions, so when they are agreed with
HTF, we will have directional bias for net longs or net shorts

We should maintain and check COT every week.
We should see commercial traders' positions. Are they bullish or bearish? Are they increasing or decreasing their
shorts or longs?

### Yield SMT Divergence
We always watch for divergence:
- When something is failed to make a higher high, then we probably can see a quarter shift from Risk-on to Risk-off
- And vise versa: of Yields are failed to make a lower low, then we might see a quarter shift from Risk-off to Risk-on

### USDX / Correlated Pairs SMT Divergence
Always look for correlated pairs we trade. Do not trade every single market, instead be a specialist in a market you
trade. Be specialist in one or maximum two markets

### Stock indexes
- ES
- NQ

### Open interest (OI)
We always watch OI or premiums in between nearby and next month out on our currency

### Market sentiment
If everybody telling on TV/news about something, then usually it will be opposite

### Key support/resistance levels on HTF

### Risk On/Off
It's good to buy currencies in a Risk-On scenario, but if we're buying then in Risk-Off, it's very-very hard to make
money in this situation.
Also, we should be buying if we agreed with HTF.
We should always trade with a Directional Bias

### Reactionary
We should kill the trade if we see that everything is going not by our plan:
- If we are in the trade, and we have little or no movement at all, and we expect a move
- Why the risk of very low odd setups?
- We want to risk our money only on high-probability setups
- If we see a rejection on a key support level if it counters to our move
