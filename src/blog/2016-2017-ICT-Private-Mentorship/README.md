## ICT Forex Scout Sniper Basic Field Guide Series
[ICT Forex Scout Sniper Basic Field Guide Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qstxYesCTQk&list=PLVgHx4Z63paZuvcenUdDQejrBV8iVOhq8&index=1&ab_channel=TheInnerCircleTrader)

We should find a directional bias on HTF and trade in that direction

We should trade in a specific time of day when price can move significantly. To do so correctly, we should
analyze the price and see when big price moves are happened in the past. FOr example, in a bearish market,
we can make all highs after which price sharply dropped lower and check if this time of day its Killzone
(KZ), or maybe Silverbullet (SB)

In bearish market (if the daily chart is poised to move lower) we have a 70% of chance high of the week
forming by the London Open on Tuesday. Sometimes, Wednesday can take a high of Tuesday London Open high
during for example, some wild news and that is can be non-profitable trade if we haven't taken partials...
Sometimes the high of the week can be formed on Monday...

If it's a bullish week, we can expect parice will trade lower on Monday or Tuesday, so we can try to find
an entry into a trade on a specific levels

We should not get into a trade if we have no key resistance/support on HFT (1D, 4h, 1h)

When the market is doing high or low on a daily chart, these Hs and Ls are significant

Major reaction levels occur on yearly Hs and Ls; Quarterly Hs and Ls (every three months, for example, in a
block of Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep and Oct-Dec, will be significant Hs and Ls); Monthly Hs and Ls; Weekly
Hs and Ls; Intra-week Hs and Ls (for example, if on Wed we have highes hi or lowest low – that one may be
a influential); standard Daily Hs and Ls

Remember to focus on a Swing Hs and Ls, these Hs and Ls are very-very strong. We should annotate all three
candles of that swing H or L. For example, whenever we have a swing high formed on a daily chart, we should
mark H&L of all three candles of that swing H.

We do not look for a trade in LTF, unless it is trading at the HTF support/resistence levels. That means
that trade should be formulated around HTF level that we already marked from a daily and/or from 4h TF

When there are a lot of uncertainties, or some global events are happening: war, terrorist attack, etc... we should:
- reduce our leverage
- slow down our expectations

When we start new week, we can try to use Fri range

When we see three indians pattern, which is going into the old high, it might be significant.
We should see if there will be a brake lower, if it is, then we may go short with a high probability setup right after
reversal

### 10-year T-Notes, Yields

When the 10-year T-Note futures contract (Bond) is rallying, Dollar rallying sd wel, then the 10-year Yield for that
10-year T-Note would be declining, as well as foreign currencies.
And vise versa: when the 10-year T-Note futures contract (Bonds) is dropping, that means that 10-year Yield will be
going higher, Dollar bearish and Foreign currencies bullish

If we want to be a buyer of the currency (for example, EUR/USD), we should do that when the 10-year Bond Yield is
growing (i.e.: 10-year T-Note is dropping).
That means, as 10-year Bond Yield is going higher, the countries will chase that, because currencies are moving in the
same direction with 10-year Bond Yield.
That means, while 10-year T-Note is trading lower on HTF, should be buyer of currencies on that HTF

When we want to risk Max of our allowed leverage (depends on us what these numbers are):
- For Long trades, we can risk more than for Short trades if the 10-year Bond Yield is rallying higher
- For Short trades, we can risk more than for Long trades if the 10-year Bond Yield is dropping lower
- It doesn't means that we cannot see a counter-moves to what we expect, no, we will see how currencies are dropping
  lower even if 10-year Bond Yield is moving higher ...and we can trade short on such retracements based on HTF
  analysis... but we will use less leverage for shorts, while if we see a bullish market structure, we can trade with
  our maximum allowed leverage, because Long trades will be agreed with our 10-year Bond Yield HTF analysis

### Power of three

When there is a small inside day (not Sunday, this one should be ignored completely), then we can expect that next day
or two real big move will happen.
We want to trade inside a consolidations when the market is boring...
And when a big and explosive move happens, we hopefully will be in position, and the market hopefully will be moving in
our favor, and its duration can be 1 day or 2 days or even three days

On large-range days, the open tends to be at the opposite extreme of the daily range opposed to the close.
Meaning if it's a big bullish-range day, then open of that day will be lower than close and vise versa: if it's a big
bearish-range day, then open will be near to the high, while close will be near to the low

Also on a such big-range days, price usually not staying very long time, it will probably take some stops or quickly
reprice to some key level and then quickly move in its real direction. It means, that wo we should follow when to get
into a trade and our goal is to catch the whole daily move.

TODO: Backtest this:
We should hunt to catch a power of three daily range moves in between midnight and 2pm.
Usually we can see some king of manipulation and then move towards our targets and objectives.
If this is going to be a big bullish day, then after midnight in London Open we can see some kind of manipulation with
a fake move below the midnight opening price. Then NY Open can be a continuation up to NY Close. From NY Lunch price
most likely will not be moving until Asia...

### Killzones (EST)
- Europe (Hunt Directional Bias):
    - 02:00am-11:00am Frankfurt
    - 03:00am-12:00pm London
      - London Open: 01:00am-05:00am
- America:
    - 08:00am-17:00pm NY
      - NY Open: 07:00am-10:00am
    - 09:00am-18:00pm Chicago
- Asia (accumulation):
    - 19:00pm-04:00am Tokyo
    - 20:00pm-05:00am Hong Kong
- Pacific (accumulation):
    - 17:00pm-02:00am Sydney
    - 17:00pm-01:00am Wellington

#### Frankfurt
The hunt starts at 02:00am, because the close outcry is at 14:00pm.
Hunt the move that sets the H or the L of the day.
Trade Directional bias

#### London
Frankfurt hunt trade will be closing into London Close or before 14:00pm no matter if we were right on a directional
bias.
If we are not in the position before 05:00am, we close our charts and go to sleep until NY Open, somewhere before
07:00am (for example, at 06:30am we can check charts what is going on...)
Many times the move starts about 07:00am. Or in between 07:00am and 07:30am, because open outcry is starts at 07:20

### Sessions Hs and Ls
TODO: Backtest this: With the help of marking London H and L, later, we can in NY Open session use OTE for continuation

### Market Make Business Models

#### Market Make Buy Models
We can participate on a move lower right after the consolidation phase, when price trade lower and then come back to
low of the initial consolidation or even higher (OTE)

We should not trade and catch the low until we get confirmation that it was a reversal.
Confirmation can come in form of Market Struncture ShiftL MSS or Brake of Market Structure after a reversal pattern has
been formed around some support level or after liquidity is taken.
Many times the price will back and test reversal as support and give a buying opportunity on accumulation phase

We also can get into the trade in optional re-accumulation phase (which may not occur) if we are still in discount

#### Market Make Sell Models
Same thing as for Market Maker Buy Model, but in reverse:

We always start from consolidation.
When move out from consolidation, the H of that consolidation usually can be retested (but its optional and doesn't
always have to happen)

Then price will rally up to clearly defined liquidity (resistance) with reversal formation

Many times we will see how price leaving reversal and come back to re-test reversal low (optional)

Price will not stay long in reversal, usually it happens fast, so we should sell in re-accumulation phase(s)

### Tracking Institutional Price Action
As we know, when 10-year T-Note Yields (Bonds) are moving higher on HTF, Foreign Currency price will chase ("seek")
Yields.
So when the 10-Year T-Note Futures Market (Bonds) is going lower, that means that Yields will be moving higher and all
Currencies will be chasing that as well.
Meaning it will be Bullish for Currencies and Bearish for the US Dollar.
And vise versa, if 10-Year T-Notes (or Bonds) are rallying on a Futures Market, then that is going to decline Yields,
and it will be Bullish for the US Dollar and Bearish for Foreign Currencies

Next ICT showed how during ICT Killzones (KZs) we can use Optimal Trade Entry (OTE).
We should see in these specific time intervals (KZs) where market can pull back to enter a trade with specific premise
in mind that market is going higher because its chasing yields

So, this is how we can formulate our idea for Directional Bias.
It doesn't mean that we will always be buy if Yields are rallying...
We will be waiting for Bullish setups more and use higher leverage for Bullish ideas than for Bearish

TODO: Backtest this:
We should clearly see how the Market is moving during ICT KZs.
So if we are Bullish, and we trade either London Open or NY Open, then we wait for retracement during these KZs and we
are buying by using OTE

ICT showed that it's important to have annotated London Open and NY Open sessions highs and lows, and also highs and
lows inside sessions, because they can be used later on retracements as an OTE entry as support/resistance

Pause in between London and NY can be treated as NY Lunch

### Hidden OTE
When we see a prior big range move, next what we could expect us small range

When we see how RELs were taken with a big NWOG, we can use those REHs as a resistence level and expect that price
might not be trading lower and closing fully that gap right-away...
So as opportunity for entry OTC low can use those REHs

We should not pick a tops or lows, we should always wait for MSS

ICT highlighted how KZs are important

Before we get into a trade, we should exactly know:
- When? KZs
- Why? Directional Bias
- How? OTE

When we see these KZs, we should learn to expect some moves and journal them

### Directional Bias: Why Do Markets Move?
What are catalysts for markets moves?

ICT showed how Moving Average indicators 9 and 18 could be used for Directional Bias.
It's just a simplified way to read Market Structure.
Of course, we should read it from Price Actions, but in the beginning we can use HTF charts with Moving Averages

### Long Term Trends
ICT tells what his tools to read institutional order flow is independent to the markets and doesn't require any
indicators

What makes trades high-probability?
It's simply a combination of multiple things:
- It's in sync with HTF Market charts and current Market environment:
    - It's Risk-On or Risk-Off?
    - Is it moving in the same direction as HTF?
    - Is it moving in accordance with yields?
- Displacements: Are we in agree with large player displacements?

### ICT no-Brainer Directional Bias
Displacements and HTF charts sync

### Candlestick patterns
It's pausing

We need institutional sponsorship.
Institutional trading it's building up position in consolidation.
When we see move up and then consolidation, then we can expect the next move up relatively the same if measure from a
consolidation (low) level: 1STDV

If the price comes back to key-level support / resistance, run stops and fail to keep going, then it's in general
telling us that it was stop raid and price will do major repricing in the opposite direction.
For example, when we have the +OB and price rallied, then com back, run stops and fail to go lower, it's a sign that
now with high probability it will go higher

We should buy on down candles. And we should sell on bullish candle

When we see +MSS, we are looking for the first down-candle prior to this move up, and this candle with the overall
bullish directional bias will be our +OB

### ICT OTE Pattern
When the market is moving higher and later price comes back, we can find our +OB as a very first bearish candle prior
to that move higher and wait for OTE at point of (origin) interest (POI).
We should always enter below Asia high, and even better below Asia low

For the weekly range, if we are bullish: we are expecting to see a weekly low from Monday London Open to Wednesday
London Open max. If Low hasn't been formed, then our idea is probably wrong

Stop Loss (SL) should be placed below second swing low on a 15 m TF - 10-15 pips if we are bullish.
Trail SL like so: move it into break-even when the first target hit and then wait for the second target

Daily and 4h charts should be agreed. If we see move opposing our directional bias, then we don't trade

We are looking for quick and sudden move in price and then wait for retracement into OB + some institutional level

Weekly and Monthly charts are also beneficial. We shouldn't look on them every single day, but we have to look at them
from time to time...

The Last three daily, last three weekly and last three monthly highs and lows are beneficial to have on our charts,
because these levels could be sensitive

Look on the charts with weekly perspective is great with 1h chart

If we are bullish, we're hunting Long setups from Mon to Wed, typically weekly low should be established in that period
and vise versa for shorts

We are not looking for trade every day, we are looking for on shot one kill setup per week consistently (that is should
be our goal)

Annotate Asia high and low each day

Look for the daily high to form in Sell Models during London Open session.
If we are bearish, we're generally looking for daily high to form during the London Open, so at this time we can form
our sell positions.
And vise versa for Buy Models

Typically high or low of the day will be formed by sharp counter-trend direction on that day (Judas Swing). It's a
false move initially to fake everyone out and then quickly rejects and go in another way

We should hunt and stack our setups by combining time and price theory: hunt inside KZs and within large OBs, found on
60-minute, 4-hour and daily TFs

Opposite high or low of daily candle usually forming during London Close (from 11:00am to 12:00pm)

Most of the time NY Open its continuation of London Open, so if we were stopped out in London Open, we can re-entry
on NY Open

Sometimes NY Open can produce reversals, so we should look on Key levels of support/resistance for these purposes

Focus on 60-minute TF for price reactions for ideal risk/reward trades (1/3)

* Risk control
* Money management
* Inter-Market analysis
* Technical analysis
* Executing Top-Down analysis

### Tracking countries interest rates (IRs)
Currencies trend long term based on IRs

Which currency has higher IRs giving us directional bias for stronger currency.
If country has lower IRs, this currency is weaker

### Seasonal tendency (ST)
Commodity market is very forecastle by ST

GBP ST:
- Major low can be made in Feb – March, Jun, Sep – Oct and Dec
- Major high in Apr – May

this is also seen in stocks as well

If currencies go down, then Bond futures market is go up (Yield is inverted and go down):
Bond ST:
- Going up from Apr to May, that means that IRs will go down, and that means currencies lower and that means dollar
  rally (Risk Off)
- Bond sideways in between Jan and Feb, and then going down into April-May, that means that IRs increasing and that
  means Risk-On, dollar lower

### COT
We should be looking on a HTF (weekly charts) and on large commercial traders positions, so when they are agreed with
HTF, we will have directional bias for net longs or net shorts

We should maintain and check COT every week.
We should see commercial traders' positions. Are they bullish or bearish? Are they increasing or decreasing their
shorts or longs?

### Yield SMT Divergence
We always watch for divergence:
- When something is failed to make a higher high, then we probably can see a quarter shift from Risk-on to Risk-off
- And vise versa: of Yields are failed to make a lower low, then we might see a quarter shift from Risk-off to Risk-on

### USDX / Correlated Pairs SMT Divergence
Always look for correlated pairs we trade. Do not trade every single market, instead be a specialist in a market you
trade. Be specialist in one or maximum two markets

### Stock indexes
- ES
- NQ

### Open interest (OI)
We always watch OI or premiums in between nearby and next month out on our currency

### Market sentiment
If everybody telling on TV/news about something, then usually it will be opposite

### Key support/resistance levels on HTF

### Risk On/Off
It's good to buy currencies in a Risk-On scenario, but if we're buying then in Risk-Off, it's very-very hard to make
money in this situation.
Also, we should be buying if we agreed with HTF.
We should always trade with a Directional Bias

### Reactionary
We should kill the trade if we see that everything is going not by our plan:
- If we are in the trade, and we have little or no movement at all, and we expect a move
- Why the risk of very low odd setups?
- We want to risk our money only on high-probability setups
- If we see a rejection on a key support level if it counters to our move

### Example
[TODO TBD](https://youtu.be/FZ6QIWBu688?t=571)

- Check Seasonal Tendencies: Bullish Market environment
- Check Interest Rates: either price chase higher, or we are looking for IRs SMT Divergences
- US Dollar is weakening (Risk On) or this is a topping formation
- Treasury Notes (2-year, 5-year, 10-year) are declining on a daily charts - Inverting Relationship Yields
- COT: Commertials hopefully being in Net Long positions or Agressive Leesing Shorts positions (we can see it in Open
  Interest (OI)
- Sentiment ideally should be oversold on a daily charts (Tool: Daily W%r basis)
- Stock Indices are Firm to bullish
- Commodities are bullish, CRB Index firm to bullish
- Gold and Oil are firm to Bullish
- Yields triade 2Y/5Y/10Y (US/UK/German or EU)
    - Bullish divergence (+DIV), when one of yields failed to make a lower low
    - Bearish divergence (-DIV), when one of yields failed to make an equal highs
- US Dollar SMT Divergence (USDX SMT):
    - Bullish +USXS SMT Divergence: If Dollar Index made a lower low, but EUR and/or GBP failed to make a higher high
      and this is will be bearish for EUR and/or GBP
    - Bullish +USXS SMT Divergence: If EUR and/or GBP made a higher high, bu t the Dollar Index failed to make
      lower low, then this is bearish for EUR and/or GBP and bullish for US Dollar
    - Bearish -USXS SMT Divergence: If Dollar Index made a higher high, but EUR and/or GDP failed to make a lower low
      and this is will be bullish for EUR and/or GBP
    - Bearish -USXS SMT Divergence: If EUR and/or GDP failed to made a lower low, but the Dollar Index failed to make
      higher high, then this is bullish for EUR and/or GBP and bearish for US Dollar
- Cor. Pairs SMT:
    - Compare lows on EUR and GBP, if one failed to make a lower low, then this might be a bullish sign for that currency
    - Compare highs on EUR and GBP, if one failed to make a higher high, then this might be a bearish sign for a currency
- Stock Indices SMT Divergence between ES, NQ and YM:
    - Bullish: if one of them failed to make a lower low at key HTF level
    - Bearish: if one of them failed to make a higher high at key HTF level
- OI:
    - Bullish: OI rapidly dropped about 50% at support level
    - Bearish: OI rapidly increased about 20% or more at resistance level

NOTE: Firm bullish means: indicating unwillingness to go lower

#### OI, COT, Risk-Off, Seasonal Tendencies
[OI, COT, Risk-Off, Weak currencies](https://youtu.be/FZ6QIWBu688?feature=shared&t=2384)
Typically, in spring we can see a weakness of the marketplace. GBP making seasonal high in Apr–May and then trading
down into the summer months.
And it's gonna be a mirror image in reverse in Dollar Index, meaning that Dollar should rally up in summer months.
If we see that Open Interest (OI) is dropping during a consolidation, this is a commercial traders are tipping their
hand, that soon this is no longer going to be staying within that smaller consolidation range. They expect that price
trade higher... Why? Because OI has been declining and they will accumulate (lessening their shorts).
How to confirm that? We need to see on COT commertials, if they are below zero-line (shorts) and if these shorts are
reducing, then it's an indicator for us that they are bullish

- Trade long in the observance of a Bullish MMP. See Fractal: it's a pattern that is generally
  visible
- Look for price patterns and confluences
- We will be entering in trade with +FVGs or +OB or OTE
- Using Fib extension for profits

#### Sell
- Trade short with a Bearish MMP
- Look for price patterns and confluences
- We will be entering in trade with -FVGs or -OB or OTE
- Using Fib extension for profits

#### Risk
- Not more than 2%
- After losing trade reduce risk twice
- After loosing was mitigated, we can back up to 2%
- We are looking to remove a risk, go to brake-even and then get something to be paid

#### Market-Market Profile: The Buy Model (MMBM)
[Market-Market Profile: The Buy Model (MMBM)](https://youtu.be/s9bg8JF7rm8?feature=shared&t=628)

- Consolidation is happening on 1h charts near resistance level (Asia).
  During consolidation, we will be hunting reversal patterns:
    - Turtle Soup Sell
    - -FVG Sell
    - -Breaker Sell
    - -OR Sell
    - +IFVG Sell
    - Bearish Hammer (Bearish Pin bar)
    - OTE Sell
- When a price drops lower after MSS (Market Structure Shift), we can also sell.
  The price can retest consolidation low, but may and not retrace and continue dropping lower into higher TF
  key-support level for lons: +FVG, +OB, Sellside Liquidity (key-resistance level for shorts: -FVG, -OB, ...)
- As soon as Reversal was form with +MSS, we can trade long
- On distribution and re-distribution phases, we should take some profits, because it may be OTE for shorts continuation
  on higher TFs
- As soon as price trades above original consolidation, we should take full profit

#### Market-Market Profile: The Sell Model (MMSM)
[Market-Market Profile: The Sell Model (MMSM)](https://youtu.be/s9bg8JF7rm8?feature=shared&t=1412)

- The market is pre-dispose to go up
- Everything else is the same as for MMBM

#### Market Structure (ST)
[Market Structure (ST)](https://youtu.be/s9bg8JF7rm8?feature=shared&t=1730)

- Short-Term Highs (STHs) and Lows (STLs)
- Intermediate-Term Highs (ITHs) and Lows (ITLs) with 2 STHs/STLs on a both sides of it
- Long-Term Highs (LTHs) and Lows (LTLs) with 2 ITHs/ITLs on a both sides of it
- Price go up to go down. Price go down to go up
- If on HTF we are Bullish, then our expectation is that we will break resistance and then come back to it as to
  support. Same vice versa if we are Bearish on a HTF

#### Asian Range
[Asian Range](https://youtu.be/VCcVx5cbAxU?t=584)
We should trade in the direction of the day and in the direction of the week.
So if we have daily bias and its in sync with a directional bias, our chances are higher.
We should use Midnight open for PO3 and as a reference for a new day.
The Asian Range is a 5-hour window from 19:00 to 24:00 (00:00).
During the Asian Range, Smart Money preparing for the day.

Mark Asia Range for previous Fri and this week Sun/Mon:
Very often these ranges will act as a support / resistence during a week

#### London Open
If we are bullish, and we're expecting that next week's Friday close will be higher that Sunday's opening, we start
looking at 1:00am if low can be form during the first 4 hours in the London session. Ideally, we are expecting that may
happen somewhere in between 2am and 3am, but it may form from in between 2:00am and 4:00am.

### Time & Price Theory
[ICT Forex - Time & Price Theory](https://youtu.be/Sb9m_dxr4bI)
- Monthly chart:
    - Bias
    - Long-Term Key Highs and Lows
    - Mark Monthly Open prices (P03) and:
      - Buy below month opening if Bullish until Long-Term Key Level hits
      - Sell above month opening if Bearish until Long-Term Key Level hits
- Weekly chart:
    - Bias
    - PO3 on specific days to buy below opening if Bullish or sell above Opening Sunday's Price if Bearish
- Daily chart:
    - Daily provides Short-Term institutional bias as executable TF
    - Buy at or below Opening Midnight Price if Bullish
    - Sell at or above Opening Midnight Price if Bearish
    - Day trading is not every day trading
    - Highest probability trade on a Daily will be in agreed with both Weekly and Monthly directional bias

### How to capture explosive moves
[ICT Forex - How To Find Explosive Price Moves Before They Happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxsmSMsuleY)
- COT
- Weekly protraction by using inside bar:
  If a small body candle was formed after a big one and we have bullish bias, we can buy and expect a big move on the
  next day(s).
  Disregard a candles wicks.
- Same for Daily protraction

### Weekly Bias
[ICT Forex - The Weekly Bias - Excellence In Short Term Trading](https://youtu.be/Yqio1Ja0lIQ)
- Focus on Opening Price on Sunday, Extend ot until Friday
- We will be looking on PO3 for weekly range
- 15-30-60 charts can give us intraday swing points
- In general, we need to have weekly bias and:
- if bullish:
  - The Low of the week should form below Sunday's opening price
  - Buy below Sun opening price (oversold condition is when opening price is higher than we want to buy)
- if bearish:
  - The High of the week should form above Sunday's opening price
  - Sell abow Sun opening price (overbought condition is when opening price is lower than we want to buy)

  [how to trade London Open KZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8OEsUAoIWE&ab_channel=TheInnerCircleTrader) (Killzones),
  to know how to map them out on London Open KZ and NY open KZ
- See video of
  [ICT Forex - Trading The Key Swing Points](https://youtu.be/T0JyGdJ28fM)
    - General rule of thumb (Engineering the Liquidity):
      - AO
        - Asia Open can be High or Low of the Day
        - Or it can consolidate ahead of London Open
      - LO
        - London Open can be High or Low of the Day
        - Or it can retrace from the Asian Open
      - NYO
        - New York Open also can create a High or a Low of the Day
        - Or it can be a retracement from London
      - LC
        - London Close can be a Low or High of the day (opposite end of the range)
        - Or it can be a Reversal Point longer term
    - But it's not always a case, in some instances:
      - AO will create Daily High or Low
      - And LO can create opposite Daily Low or High
    - Or if, for example, Asia creates a Low and then starts run higher:
      - LO can be a part of the retracement
      - When AO creates Low or High of the day
    - So how to use this information?
      - If Asia creates a High or a Low, and starts to run, and expand outside the Asian Range, then dropdown in London
        is typically going to be a retracement of initial impuls leg of the move started in Asia. So if we are
        Bullish, and we assume that Asia created a Low of the day, then we can be Long in London retracement. So LO can
        be a part of the move that originates from an Asian Open
      - If, for example, we are Bearish, NYO can raid on Liquidity for both AO and LO (for example, on some high impact
        news), create High of the Day and then go lower and create Low of the Day
      - If, for example, we are Bullish, NYO can be part of the retracement from London Open where Low of the Day was
        form ...and then it can go higher
      - If we are Bullish, LC can create high of the day. It doesn't need to close higher, it can reverse all the way
        down lower after, but anyway it may create high of the day after some Buyside liquidity Raid
      - For example, at the end of the week, on Friday we have traded higher during an LC period. It made high of
        the week and then next week/day(s) market goes lower, so that last Friday LC was a Reversal Point loner term
    - So how to use these Swing Points?
      - We will be using HTF price levels as a resistence or support to expect where price can go
      - For example, we can see some key resistence level on a Daily chart, and when we see how during LO price came
        into this level, and we can go short if this level acts as a resistence. So even if the day was Bullish, at
        this point of time we can be a seller during the London and target the nearest Pool of Liquidity
      - Practice: Go to 15m or 30m charts and check all the times when the Market turns and creates significant daily
        Highs and Lows. Also check intra weeks Highs and Lows. And Monthly Highs and Lows. Check where it was formed,
        what KZ it was. By doing that, we will learn where high probability turning points and when are forming...
- AO: [ICT Forex - The ICT Asian Killzone](https://youtu.be/ley5HZs4bUM)
  - Monitor from 19:00 to 21:00 (24:00). Whole Asian KZ is from 19:00 to 00:00 (24:00)
  - Pairs: AUD, NZD, JPY. Pairs which are not crosses with Dollar Index are most active in this time of day (AUS/JPY,
    GBP/AUD, AUD/JPY, EUR/AUS, GBP/CHF)
  - 15-20 pips (20-50 pips on non Dollar crosses)
  - Least active time for trading unless we want to trade pairs mentioned above
  - We are looking a move which is formed immediately after AO (exit trade prior to FO or LO).
- LO: [ICT Forex - The ICT London Killzone](https://youtu.be/G8OEsUAoIWE)
  - Monitor from 2:00 to 5:00
  - Pairs: EUR, GBP.
  - 25-50 pips
  - LO has a highest probability to create High or Low of the day
  - London Lunch from 5:00 to 7:00
  - If the London session is trending, we have chances to see quite NY session
  - If the London session wasn't a trending (traded in a range), then we have chances to see a trending NY session
  - London session typically creates a Low of the day If we are Bullish
  - London session typically creates a High of the day If we are Bearish
  - If we have very narrow consolidation on a Asian Range, we may expact huge move on LO or/and NYO
    [ICT Forex - Implementing The Asian Range](https://youtu.be/JA0mLNJeytY)
- NYO: [ICT Forex - The ICT New York Killzone](https://youtu.be/plNN9n7nrxc)
  - Monitor from 7:00 to 9:00 (In some cases from 7:00 to 14:00)
  - Pairs of Dollar crosses. Every NYO has a setup for one or more major pairs, not all of them
  - 20-30 pips
  - If LO was missed, or we want to mitigate a loss, then NYO session is ideal
  - NYO is harder to trade than LO, but we have London insides and London overlap New York
  - One of the characteristics is: Continuation of London where we can get into a trade on a retracement
  - Another characteristic is: Reversal, which is more complex to expect for developing trader
- LC: [ICT Forex - The ICT London Close Killzone](https://youtu.be/3OEUIkkcmLE)
  - Monitor from 10:00 to 12:00
  - 10-20 pips
  - Very short-term OTE on 5-minute charts
  - Can create a Low of the day and then reverse with entry on next higher Low on retracement
  - Can create continuation points for NY
  - Can also create a reversal point after price reaches HTF key level (liquidity or turtle soup)

### Daily Bias and PO3

  - [ICT Forex - Essentials To Trading The Daily Bias](https://youtu.be/vJvcZGGeTZU)
  - [ICT Forex Lesson - Keys To Daily Bias In The Forex Market](https://youtu.be/RLDLuYaZYI4?feature=shared&t=148)
    - How to reduce it to where we are not struggling:
      - We should look at least a year for the data of:
        - Stocks
        - Commodity
        - Couple different Forex pairs
        - Futures Indexes like S&P500
      - And really tackle, learn, journal, each individual day for every one of them, for the full year
      - Count and journal:
        - How many times is the market did go up?
        - How many times is the market did go down?
        - How many times is the market did go up and at what day of the week?
        - How many times is the market did go down and on what day of the week?
        - Classify bias initially for the weekly range:
          - Is it going up?
          - Or it is going down?
        - What time of the day it made a low of the day?
        - What time of the day it made a high of the day?
        - Also check the economic calendar, wait and see for manipulation, and here is our setup
  - KZs:
    - FX (Asia) KZ is in between 19:00 and 00:00
    - FX LO (London Open) KZ is in between 02:00 and noon 05:00
    - FX NYO (New York Open) KZ is in between 07:00 and 10:00
    - FX LC (London Close) KZ is in between 10:00 and noon 12:00
  - PO3:
    - Daily Bias doesn't mean that price should close higher if we are Bullish (or close lower if we are Bearish)...
      Daily Bias means that the price will most likely expand higher if we are Bullish (or expand lower if we are
      Bearish)
    - If we are Bullish, generally we do not expect a lot of price action below midnight opening at 00:00, it can, but
      we are just not expecting it
    - If we are Bullish, we want to buy below opening price, at the opening price or just above it (and reverse if
      Bearish)
    - Draw the line from 00:00 to 11:00 every single day and study that PO3 phenomenon. Write notes for every day and
      observe it. Then you will get that experience, and then you will be able to use it in your trading
    - If we have a very little manipulation movement and then price expanded also not very far (30–35 pips) and it
      enters NYO... Generally, in this situation we can retrace and travel below midnight open during NYO session
      (especially if there is high or medium impact news), so we can catch a low of the day in that way... And then we
      would expect price to expand into upside...
    - So the high of the Day is what we are really targeting, not higher Close of the Day than Day Open, becayse we are
      not required that price should close higher... We want expansion higher if we are Bullish. So, our Input is:
      Midnight Open and out Output: High of Day
    - Where may price reach into? The average range of the day: this is something we can use if it's not clear where
      the high of the day may form...
    - We should practice to see candles live, how do they burn, live and die. Market replay doesn't help
    - What high price we are looking for if we are Bullish? We are looking for a Draw On Liquidity.
    - Liquidity is pending orders that are waiting: Why should the market go up or why should the market go down?
    - If we are Bullish, then the market can go up to previous daily high or just above it, because there are pending
      orders - stops of traders that are opened short
    - Liquidity can be above singular high or REH: relative equals highs if we are Bullish
    - LO (London Open) can be our first opportunity, and NYO (New York Open) can be our second opportunity to get into
      a trade
    - Draw On Liquidity is where the market is likely to go. So old high is our Draw On Liquidity
    - Institutional Order Flow:
      - First, we are looking, and we try to find it on the Weekly chart:
        - Where can the next weekly candle go? Higher or lower?
        - If we cannot determine where the next weekly candle goes, we sit still and wait until Monday, and usually we
          are wait end of the Monday. What Monday should tell us? Does it provide any inside where weekly candle may go?
        - Monday can be an expansion day, and we can miss big range, and it's okay
        - Every time the price starts expansion from a consolidation, we should think: "where is Draw On Liquidity?"
        - When we see indecisive weekly candle or down weekly candle during range of expansion higher, then it's giving
          us a high probability for big expansion higher next week
      - Next, we are looking on is a Daily chart:
        - Bullish Daily Bias doesn't mean Bullish trade every single day
        - If we lons in London Open, and we lost in New York Open, then we have to stop. We don't need to lose more
          money, to understand and confirm that we are really-really wrong
        - If our Bias is Bullish, and we have Bearish Order Block higher, we are looking with this Bullish premise in
          mind only until we reach the Bearish OB. Our -OB: it's just a target. It doesn't mean that it will reverse,
          it can, but it doesn't mean this
      - Next we go into hourly chart
      - Model for FOMC and other high/medium impact news:
        - If we are bullish (our HTF Bias is Bullish)
        - We had a consolidation
        - Before high impact or medium impact news we took a Buyside first
        - During the news, we took Sellside
        - We have a trade: After manipulation is happened, we can get into trade:
          - We can either buy near to low during news on manipulation phase
          - Or we can wait any bullish PDArray after manipulation and buy there

Cross-pairs analysis:
- If the Dollar Index is Bullish on a Daily chart:
    - And EUR/GBP is Bullish on a Daily chart:
        - Then EUR/USD is rallying & GBP/USD consolidates
        - Or EUR/USD consolidates & GBP/USD is dropping
        - So we want to trade high-probability setup: Sell Short GBP/USD
        - And we don't want to trade low-probability setups:
          - Sell Short EUR/USD (we don't want it because EUR/USD is rallying or consolidates)
          - Buy Long EUR/USD (we don't want it because Dollar Index rallying)
    - And EUR/GBP is Bearish on a Daily chart:
        - Then GBP/USD rallying & EUR/USD consolidates
        - Or GBP/USD consolidates & EUR/USD dropping
        - So we want to trade high-probability setup: Sell Short EUR/USD
        - And we don't want to trade low-probability setups:
            - Sell Short GBP/USD (we don't want it because GBP/USD is rallying or consolidates)
            - Buy Long GBP/USD (we don't want it because Dollar Index rallying)
- If the Dollar Index is Bearish on a Daily chart:
    - And EUR/GBP is Bullish on a Daily chart:
        - Then EUR/USD is rallying & GBP/USD is also rallying
        - Or EUR/USD is rallying & GBP/USD consolidates
        - So we want to trade high-probability setup: Buy Long EUR/USD
        - And we don't want to trade low-probability setups:
            - Sell Short GBP/USD (we don't want it because it may rally)
            - Buy Long GBP/USD (we don't want it because it may consolidate)
    - And EUR/GBP is Bearish on a Daily chart:
        - Then GBP/USD is rallying & EUR/USD is also rallying
        - Or GBP/USD is rallying & EUR/USD consolidates
        - So we want to trade high-probability setup: Buy Long GBP/USD
        - And we don't want to trade low-probability setups:
            - Sell Short EUR/USD (we don't want it because it may rally)
            - Buy Long EUR/USD (we don't want it because it may consolidate)
