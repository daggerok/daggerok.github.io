## 2025 Lecture Series - Housekeeping
[2025 Lecture Series - Housekeeping](https://youtu.be/6wt3xy34bNk) it's an introduction lecture where ICT showed his
statements related to Robins Cup and told about 2024 Model hi is going to be use with his son Caleb in 2025 in AMP Live
Broker

ICT showed that he hasn't traded every day:
If rules are not met, we sit still and not trading on that...

- We should have realistic expectations and reduce our risk. We should start with Micro contract
- Knowing how price tends to deliver based and by time:
  - How to use economic calendar
  - Understanding time-based delivery: Macros. Certain aspects. When is the market usually runs/consolidates/reverse?
  - Understanding key pools of liquidity and how it will be engaged by price, why it will be drawn of liquidity?
  - Identifying inefficiencies in the price. Which are most important?
  - Using simple points of entry and low-hanging fruit produce objectives for targets. And then wash, rinse, repeat...

We also will learn how to use:
- Opening Range Gap (ORG: regular trading hours (RTH)), which conditions we should look at what can be interesting for us
- Opening range (OR: first 30 minutes of trading)
- Dealing Range (DR) First 60 minutes dealing range: three characteristics of the DR and how to employ therm

Do:
- Backtesting to see how ofter / when strategy is applicable
- Tape reading without pushing a button
- Forward testing with demo account or paper-trading account
- Migrate to a prop-firm founded account or live founded account (the very minimum for live funds is $1000 account to
  trade one micro contract)

## 2025 Lecture Series - Making Money With SMC Concepts
[2025 Lecture Series - Making Money With SMC Concepts]() it's a lecture about Opening Range (OR) and Opening Range Gap
(ORG)

By having RTH, we have some benefits: where is ORG

If PRG is larger than 20 handles for NQ, we can measure its C.E. and/or UQ, LQ

If the price trades higher right on opening, we want to wait and see: Where it will trade to? ICT doesn't trade such
behaviors

We have to know how price will likely to be delivered, and by time

On a Non-Payroll Farm week: we want to trade on Monday

But if we have a big gap like this, we usually tend to keep trading in the direction of the gap
(for example, on opening if we have Premium ORG and market started trade higher)

But eventually, in the afternoon, in between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock we can see a change (CISOD: Change in the State
of Delivery) or MSS (Market Structure Shift) as we enter into NY lunch macro (11:30am-13:30pm), and then we can expect
retracement move into that ORG

So ORG UQ (Upper Quadrant) is a crucial level: It can be high-probability draw on liquidity if the market can
eventually show that it can go lower

So by knowing where the market is likely wanted to trade to before it can reverse: those are important factors for that
Model. So we sit still, watch and wait for signatures. We're not trying to trade long or pick the top either... We
would like to see when the market can produce a turn lower... Also want to see that the market will provide time-based
delivery (macros). If, for example, the market opens and starts trade higher, leaving ORG below...
- What is low-hanging fruit objective? Lowest price after 9:30am opening, because its effectively low of the day, at
  the new start of RTH
- What is high-probability draw on liquidity? ORG UQ. It could, but we are not going to require it
- What is the lowest target where we should close a position? ORG C.E, and we are not going to require it as well

Now, we should go into 60-minute chart and find a DR (dealing range), meaning previous swing high (ITH/LTH) and
previous swing low (ITL/LTL). If previous DR By having it, we do not need to expect that price will draw on liquidity
above/below H/L... All we need is understand: where is Premium and where is Discount? So if the liquidity of previous
DR was by some breaker os so, it's high probability. And if we are below a DR C.E., we are in Discount.
So if we are in discount and liquidity was taken, its high-probability trade: targets can be found above any high or
inside inefficiencies in Premium

By having DR we also have a benefits to know where we want to sell shorts or take longs profits; and where to place
longs or take shorts profits. Simply everything is below equilibrium we use to trade longs and anything above for
shorts

When we have such a big Premium ORG (like several hundred handles for NQ), and the price is traded higher, then we can
expect, that price may keep trading higher in that direction, so we should be careful...
Similarly, vice versa, if we have huge Discount ORG, price can keep continue trade lower.
So we don't want to chase this price. we should wait until the market will show us that it wants to reverse or start
rollover... But better is, of course, if after some significant Buyside has been taken if we see MSS with displacement

Potential Model for trading NY pm sessions could be next:
- If at 13:30, we already can see that marked has been delivered to some inefficiency and made it efficient
- At that point of time, we want to see if price does move lower
- Does it breach a mid-point of the inefficiency?
- Does it show us key signatures that price is respected C.E and algorith is offering price for smart money to get into
  trade?
- And if we see all of that, we don't want to simply get into trade right here and right now, because we know about the
  main part: time, so we want to see if we can get into the trade on macro and expect a fast and sudden price move in
  our favor
- We want to kn ow where it's likely to draw to and target that liquidity as our TP
- We want a simple entry strategy
- So we want to frame an idea around all thoseðŸ‘† things

## 2025 Lecture Series - SMC Midnight Opening Range
[2025 Lecture Series - SMC Midnight Opening Range](https://youtu.be/Z0VYZoaTIKE) it's a lecture about Midnight Opening
Range (MOR)

We should think about next: How do we find a framework uses this information:
- First beginning point os ORG
- The Framework that we use around ORGs is derived by MOR (12:00am-12:30am)
- If we trade before ORG, we should trade with MOR in mind and potential ORG which will form and 9:30am
- These PDArrays (MOR, ORG) is all about every significant price run (which is worth to measure), which every trader
  wants to be a part of
