# ICT Mentorship 2024
This is my ICT 2024 Mentorship notes in reverse (descending by date) order.
I started to learn it at the end of 2023, but the topic is quite big and complex.
ICT said that hist students should make a notes because it's not realistic to keep everything in memory...

Mark NDOG (H, L, and C.E.) It's where the market stopped trade yesterday at 5pm and started trade yesterday at 6pm.
The NDOG is influential up to 5 trading days.
The older NDOG, the lower influence it will have.

The Mark NWOG (H, L, and C.E.) It's where the market stopped trade on Fri at 5pm and started trade on Sun at 6pm.
NWOG is influential up to 5 trading weeks.
The older NWOG, the lower influence it will have.

if NDOG or NWOG is lacking one of any sides of delivery (Sellside or Buyside), then later market will react on these
levels.

If there is no data in NYam, try to trade NYpm session.
In this case, be in front of the charts at 13:30 to wait NYpm SB at 14:00.
If nothing is happened, then we wait for 15:00

First, our task is study price action, collect old data and journaling.
Next, stage is tape read and assume what price can do.
Next, we can start do entries and executions to lost feeling that we can do wrong entry.

Tomorrow (2024-08-08) ICT is 52.

TODO: Watch this lecture again.

We start mark relative-equal highs / lows only after 7:00

FVG should be marked together with VI

High-probability rel.eq.highs are: left high one is lower than right high.

Breaker idea: waiting for stop run and then back into the range and then retrace to Breaker
iFVG: the highest form of precession, if we have a Gap post 7:00 that runs after rel.eq.H has been taken and makes a new
high after a long prior run in London. It might be a reversal. If there was a stop run and Breaker and FVG was form,
then we can use Model 2022, OTE and Breaker trade, but most important is to trade internal FVG in Breaker if it's
available!

The very first FVG prior to stop run (reversal) because it's a change in the state of delivery.
If there is no that FVG, then we are trading Breaker.

After reversal, we focus only on SiBis unless a direction won't be changed.

We are mark every single short-term high as well, because there are stops sitting.
Every FVG

At 7:00 we start a hunt, and if we see shark and jagged price action, then it probably will go opposite.

We are never annotate our charts in negative manner.

If in the first 30 minutes after 7:00 / 8:00 / 9:00 there are some rel.eq.H was form when market moving in the opposite
direction, then we want to see if market will drop. If there are rel.eq.L, then we want to see that market to go higher
after these 30 minutes

After 7:00 if we have stop runs H, we take a fib from that H to the low of the first candle at 7:00 to measure STDVs.
Same for 8:00 and 9:00

### ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #1 August 5, 2024
[ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #1 August 5, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKeLVR3dPuI&list=PLVgHx4Z63paaM41aubnHOmqfeNjSAoBCV&index=1&ab_channel=TheInnerCircleTrader)

Our Task: studying price at specific time of the day

At 7:00-7:30 EST,
At 8:00-8:30 EST,
At 9:00-9:30 EST, prior to the NY Open:

* we are already on front of the charts
* we are looking at where highs and lows are
* we are looking at 3 timeframes: 15m => 5m => 1m
    * 15m: where is the market is smooth => liquidity levels and inefficiencies
    * 5m: where is the market is smooth => liquidity levels and inefficiencies
    * 1m: where is the market is smooth => liquidity levels and inefficiencies
* when we see market structure shift and  anticipating price run above short-term low, we do measure, because we have
  zero-baseline exp., and we do journal:
    * record how long that price run is taken (for example, how many 1m candles)
    * record or screenshot honestly, what it felt for us physically (anxiety, impatient, excited, etc...)
* we should trade only one micro contract, at least 1 year of studying... we can start thinking of pyramiding, but we
  can't do pyramiding at least 1 year! This is how we study ICT. This is the only thing we can do to remove greed and
  fear. We can't blow the account by trading one micro contract and we only take one trade a day

Every single-day algorithm will always do this: run on liquidity (orders sitting inside inefficiencies, or above old
highs or below old lows) where the market needs to offer fair value to the marketplace.
Once we know that market is likely to do these things (run on liquidity or inside inefficiencies), that's an algorithmic
characteristic.

So we want to daily bias, and we want to trade that: buy below the open and hold for the whole the entire day.
And it's really hard, because we start thinking about securing our profitable trade, so patience and waiting became the
hardest wrestling match...
But the reason why we so stress about it, is because we don't know what we are doing. We haven't done that waiting part
long enough, where we completely desensitized to get comfortable with and anticipating price moves and get comfortable
with to not knowing what it's going to do next (this candle, next candle, five candles from now and so on...) but when
we are thinking that its going to draw on to this specific price levels, we have marked on 8:00-8:30

As soon as we pushed the button, we've entered the jungle; yours is mine or mine is yours. Are we a liquidity? If we are
a liquidity, we are the lunch. We should go in, and we are looking for lunch, for liquidity, we are looking that market
can go into specified levels at 8:00-8:30 EST. It can draw on Liquidity in directional movement. It may not draw on that
liquidity, but the market is probably going to move until it hits that level. It doesn't mean that it can't have
a replacement lower or it doesn't mean that it can't make a lower low (new low of the day), highly unlikely but not
impossible.

Anyway, we should still have an initial idea and follow the rules. So when we are first trying to learn how to read
these markets and when we are first trying to determen where the market is likely to go... We have to strip away
everything that we're trying to force into reading every single individual candlestick

So when we are looking at the price, as new students we should approach it kind of the game and a discovery, something
fun. Not a video game, but its game of determining does it have what it takes to move to those highs? A way of saying to
yourself that it's very disarming. Okay, like: I see how this is smooth, - these two highs are relatively-equal... That
looks like a really nice obvious flat space in price. If on opposite site we don't see same flatness, then it may have
some meaning for us.

The market will go in area of smoothness for the purpose of run on liquidity and pair any orders will sitting above old
or relative equal highs or below old or relative equal lows...

What is smooth? For example, relative-equal swing highs...
When we are looking for a relative-equal highs, how do we know that it's a high probability likely to swept or traded
throw highs? When we have two swing highs and one to the left is slightly higher than one to the right, then it's a
very-very high-probability that we are going to take it above.
This is called priming. Priming is when with manipulation we create low resistance liquidity, but retail thinks that
this is a resistance. So later market and smart money can rip them all. We want to be on smart money side at that time.
When smart money do manipulation they are creating a sympathetic side (all short sellers retail crowd can relax at this
moment and put their buy stops above these relative-equal highs)

When is relative-equal low going to be swept? When after lower relative-equal high prior to draw on liquidity, a higher
low was created.

Now let's talk about a time. Because all these things are going to repeat every single day at specific periods of
time...
Every day between 8:00 and 8:30, we sitting in fron of charts and trying to define where the smooth locations in price
action on
* 15m
* 5m
* 1m

Real important note: It does not mean that this run on liquidity is having to happen during that exact session!
And that is the underlying risk we're managing every time we take into trade.

Pre-market range: 7:00-7:30 EST
Opening range is 7:30-8:00 EST

Pre-market range: 8:00-8:30 EST
Opening range is 8:30-9 :00 EST

Pre-market range: 9:00-9:30 EST
Opening range is 9:30-10:00 EST

Prior to pre-market ranges we are looking for relative-equal highs or relative-equal lows. Which side has it? Because
that's our bias, it's going to draw on that...

How do we know if we have both sides relative-equal lows and highs? We wait for draw on first and get disrupted...
Because once that happens then we work to the other. That's our bias! So we have to defer and wait

### Keynotes & Observations - May 01, 2024
[Keynotes & Observations - May 01, 2024]()

In FOMC day is 2 stage event: 1) Move start on 14:00 and complete at 14:30 2) At 14:35
I can do either reversal or continue

Non-Farm Payroll is also nopt possible for trading - algorithm is turn off and manual
intervention will be turned on

How to detect time when LRL in place? If there are no news drivers.

Session bias can be built for 4h and 1h charts: were we are? where are we going from?
where are we going to (block, inefficiency, C.E, draw on liquidity etc...)?

Why we don't want Opening Range Gap fill completely if we are Bearish? Because if it
cannot fill that Gap it means that it Very Bearish.

We can expect as retail traders want to go short after big down day, so smart money
wants to trap them. Takeaway from this is: when retail public crowd want to sell,
smart money want to move markets higher to get everybody else Byu stops.

### Reading Price Without A Bias - April 30, 2024
[Reading Price Without A Bias - April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joqM_Z96vtM)

Do not trade on non-farm payroll week from after lunch Wed till Fri.
If we want we can trade 15-30 minutes after non-farm payroll numbers report.

Reclaimed FVG / Reclaimed OB is when initial expectations is used at later time.
IFGV / Mitigation block is when its reverse the role.

Bounce price range is when you have 2 inefficiencies (BiSi and SiBi) in opposing
directions in a same general area in terms of price. Best is with 1 candle in a
middle because it would be sudden and more impactful. Or it could be pattern called
island reversal. We can trade is as iFVG

### How To Read Price With Or Without A Bias - April 29, 2024
[How To Read Price With Or Without A Bias - April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpdFdIckXqo)

Wicks == Gaps. Our focus on C.E. or upper quadrants if bullish (lower quadrants when bearish).

When we have high impact news, we are wait for damage and manipulation. Only then, after all retail
traders will be stopped out from their seats we are looking for turtle sups or other setups.

If there are no high impact news, then we can relay on macros (every single trading hour 20 minutes
macros): 9:50am-10:10am, 10:50am-11:10am, 1:50pm-2:10pm, 2:50pm-3:10pm and 3:15-3:45 last hour macro

If bullish and want to use +OB, then there should be only few down closed candles that we should use
only as opportunity to buy. If there are a lot of down closed candles, then we either on
consolidation or near to high, but definitely not in up move.

Same thing in relation to FVG, we don't want to see every FVG was fully rebalanced, we do want to
see price left some inefficiency stay opened, not fully closed, otherwise we maybe on end of the run

To capture nice day trades we need to look at 15m charts or 1h charts.
To capture nice swing trades we need to look at 1h charts or 4h charts.
To capture nice position trades we need to look at 1D charts or 1W charts.

Change in a state of delivery it's always opening price of OB. Delivery it's
directional price run, so it's going to be a change in the direction of price.

Bias must be found based on weekly and daily charts.
Don't build bias based on anything what less than 1 hour.

SM doing stop runs only to kick out everyone who can be profitable and
to catch traders who created limit orders for breakouts.

Seasonal tendency take price down into the spring decline.

In days when we have high impacted news we should use 5 minutes
timeframe to reduce choppiness and spottiness of price fluctuation.
In all other "normal" trading days we can use 1 minute and sub-minute
timeframes.
On high impact news drivers we should wait and use 5 minutes charts at
least 15-20-30 minutes and only then we can start dropping down below
5 minutes charts for looking for inefficiencies because we won't
probably pick a right one...

When I'm bullish, my stop loss should have 3 PD arrays above it or
3 PD arrays below it when I'm bearish.

Dealer range is high that was engaged buyside and low that was engaged sellside.
And it must be on a timeframe we are looking for analysis (5 minutes on high
impact driver news during 15-30 minutes after release). Best moves starts from \
running stops, so if we are bearish - we want to see that market take buy stops
first.

Algorithm is designed to range wide to seek liquidity.

Important to keep in mind quadrants and remember that best entries when we are:
* bullish: in between 50%-100% of +OB or +FVG
* bearish: in between 0%-50% of -OB or -FVG
