# ICT Mentorship 2024
This is my ICT 2024 Mentorship notes in reverse (descending by date) order.
I started to learn it at the end of 2023, but the topic is quite big and complex.
ICT said that hist students should make a notes because it's not realistic to keep everything in memory...

Assume "Jackson Hole Symposium" days as a "Non-Farm Payroll" days.

Around 11:30 during Lunch macro algorith is gonna seek a First Low, which has form after 10:00 butt first to left side
of already printed candles from 11:30... Why? Because it's a Low that has been created after SB. TODO: Study that part!

Lunch macro is in between 11:30 and 13:30

Macros for last hour:
- at 15:15 and took 30 minutes until 15:45 (last hour macro) to spool a price
- at 15:45 and took 15 minutes to retrace before close daily candle
- during earnings: at 16:00 and took 15 minutes 

So we should hold at least up to 15:45

Wick it is like FVG, so if it can't go below then it is probably going to go higher.

If there are 2 FVGs, we're always looking for first (closer), but allowing from our risk that the price can go into
second.

We should study all timeframes and find proofs be ourselves. When we are looking on a wicks, we should find how price
and candle bodies are respecting wicks, or how price can stop at wick c.e.

### ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #7

Main takeaway from this lecture:
We should not trade on tending days when we have CPI, PPI, FOMC, Non-Farm Payroll, because it is extremely manipulated.
Abd because it usually once-sided directional run we should try to have any concern right before CPI/PPI numbers report,
because no one have no idea what market is going to do. There is a low probability to set proper target or stop-loss.

We should not trade initial liquidity raid on a morning right before a PPI/CPI/FOMC numbers report, ever!
We are just waiting for news and doing nothing. 
In the morning we're just waiting to see rel.eq.H or rel.eq.L.

TGIF is when the market did retracement from 20% to 30% on a weekly candle.
If TGIF didn't form on the previous Friday.
TODO: Check it once again today and yesterday streams about that.

We are chasing the price.

TODO: Check 3 drive (Indians) pattern and this complete video.

### ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #6 August 12, 2024 Begins 9:15am ET
[ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #6 August 12, 2024 Begins 9:15am ET](https://www.youtube.com/live/woAQ1XJeD7Y?si=8vbIL3sjFElKoyEM&t=550)

We do expect a volatility (and this volatility will be until reports come out) if:
* On Mon and we pretty much no high impact news
* On Tuesday–Wednesday: CPI and/or PPI

We do not care about numbers itself. There is no way to find which way to trade (long or short) 

We do not trade this news.
We're just sitting and waiting for more data to come after that market is moving because of manual intervention...

Seek and destroy is when the market is going up to get Buyside Liquidity and then go down to get Sellside Liquidity and
then back and furth, back and furth...

Our bias that the market can gravitate lower can be expected when:
* We had previous NWOG below the price
* And we have previous NDOG below previous NWOG
* And the market is jagged
* And we have inefficiencies which where respected before an opening bell 

At 7am-8am we are waiting for rel.eq.H or rel.eq.L to form.
We define our initial liquidity after 7am, not at 7am, meaning we wait to rel.eq.H or rel.eq.H to form and then mark it
as initial liquidity. 
And then we will expect that these rel.eq.H or rel.eq.L will be raided.

Same thing if we trade after 8am

If we trade after at 9am there are some additional nuances:

It's important to not spend our mental capital. If we spend every single day / every single hour of the day what the
market is doing, then we will be unhappy, because its not healthy. Do something once a day and stop. If you positive,
but if not, it's also okay, because now you have an opportunity to study what you have done incorrectly, where you where
wrong.

For example, day before PPI/CPI the market will be choppy, go back and furth, back and furth. So if we go into trade, 
we should not be mad if our SL has been hit. To avoid this negativity, we should reduce risk, take partials or do not
trade at all.

If we have events before impactful events, then we will try to take trades early.

ICT Bearish OB doesn't require price trade below a wick before we get into trade based on that -OB.

### ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #5 August 9, 2024
[ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #5 August 9, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul6x6BwOg6M&t=457s)

Asia session: we should start to look at the market at 6pm and expect some kind of volatility from 7pm to 9pm.
We should use NWOG theory at that time of day

Price signatures? For example, if we see that price go up into bearish VFG, and it's failed to touch C.E, then it,
that is indicative of weakness, because if it cannot touch midpoint of FVG or inefficiency, then it is decidedly weak.
So we can be confident that if next we take the bearish OB as an entry if we get a FVG after that one, if we on the
15s chart, it's gonna probably a winner... Because everything is indicating that price is going to move decisively
lower... Because it can't even trade up to PD Array. So the PD Array is failing when I'm already looking for the short
and price can't even trade in or get back to the midpoint of it — that's wonderful inside that this is gonna be a nice
run... So we should look for inefficiency below an old low or rel.eq.L to trade Sellside Liquidity

The Primary factors of determining bias are: NWOGs and NDOGs. Bias itself can be reduced to the session we are trading,
or down to Silver-Bullet hour. So we can have models that has been built on next questions, for example:
* What's the bias for that hour? (model where we're determining bias for hour when we started trade) 
* What's the bias for the next three hours? (that's typically like a session bias)
* What's the bias for the entire morning before noon lunchtime? (NY.am session bias)
* What's the entire daily range bias?

We just gonna be:
1) Looking for a starting point (for Asia we gonna be waiting for 6pm)
2) And then annotate where we open in defence where we close at 5 o'clock. So that hour gap in indices (or forex 
   currencies) we annotate for a NDOG.
3) If that gap is over 80 ticks (20 handles for NQ), then we should also annotate its c.e.

Our goal is do what ICT is telling us and never go and watch the same vide once again.
Our goal should be once we go throw that Mentorship, we shouldn't ever look at what ICT is posted about the Market.
We should become independent and have our own ideas, depends on our own analysis...
Because if we want to take it seriously, we don't want my tethering between us and ICT, meaning we shouldn't be
dependent on ICT at all.  

There is a framework we gonna pull today for Daily charts, because it's silent to the discussion, but we did not refer
to anything above 15-minute charts except for a session on Monday (Lecture #1) where ICT showed big gap on a Daily
chart, which happened to be a NWOG. We will talk about it also today. And how it fits into the equation of how we're
using the clustering of inefficiencies on NDOGs and NWOGs.

The session is started at 18:00.
If we closed above and opened lower, then we have a Discount lower opening.
If gap is at least 80 ticks (20 handles for NQ), then we can annotate C.E.
By having in mind these NWOGs and NDOGs we will have understanding where we think price will go to gravitate to, or
jagged around based on for example economic calendar (like today).
If we notice that today, there are no high impact or medium news events (and / or it's Friday also). If we've had a
large weekly range (TGIF) then we wait for market to create a motion (movement) around that NWOG / NDOG.

Do not trade that gap initially as soon as we just have it annotated. Why? Because there are should be a most important
element - time, that has to be referred first. Because markets will not move until it's time for them to move (which is
algorithmic). Yes, the price can gyrate, and it may have meaningless aimless movement that we're not interested in.
But when time will be introduced as a factor, that's the greatest importance. That means that from 19:00 to 21:00 that
is our Asia session and we can use that NDOG now and build it around element of liquidity.

So for Asia, we can look back on previous NY.pm session highs/lows and compare them with Asia session highs/lows to
identify rel.eq.Hs/rel.eq.Ls. As they form, we should annotate them and expect that later above highs or below lows will
be a liquidity which Market is going to take right after its engineering. And we're doing screenshots of that in our
journal. After it happens. We don't try to predict them. We don't try to put them to work right now and see if it works
right now, no! We do type reading. Months before we will try even demo trade them. We studying it after that happened,
and then we do walk forward when we're watching price without any button pushing, without any kind of hard opinion.
But we are doing it with expectation of collecting experience watching it.
Also, any kind of previous/current session STHs/STLs also can be annotated like a minor Buyside/Sellside Liquidity pool
right after it happened.

But what we really waiting for is we wanna see two things:
* Price should leave NDOG
* Price should cross below or above it
* When Price goes below NDOG, we wanna see that STL has been taken
* When Price goes above NDOG, we wanna see that STH has been taken
* And as soon Price will do that (cross below or above NDOG and take STL or STH), then it sets the initial range to
  build and engineer liquidity.

So, as soon as price (after opening) made a STL (or STH) and then cross above (or below) NDOG to create STH (or STL),
we now have an initial range, which is in between first session STL and STH.
Initial Buystops will be sitting above that range and Initial Sellstops will be below it.
Why "Initial"? Because we open a new trading Day and these two are first what algorithm has been engineered.

There will be a days when price doesn't take any initial Short-Term Buyside/Sellside, sideways around NDOG and do
nothing, won't even bump above or below... If it doesn't do anything described, don't worry about it, its typically
telling us that Asia is going to be dull. It probably won't do anything where we can make money, and it's probably
just go and do something else (watch the movie with spouse, do exersises and then go to bed early and rest for your
workday tomorrow)

But we want to be doing things with a purpose of knowing that it's gonna fit these characteristics that are synonymous
with the market making a sizable predictable move. And if its really lethargic and lackluster at 6 o'clock, and if it
doesn't really do anything going into 7 o'clock (because that is our key time, at 19:00 starts the Asian session), just
being done for today and go away.

So after initial pools of liquidity and initial range was formed, we should look to the left. Where are larger pools of
liquidity sitting (other Short-Term Highs or Lows, ITH, ITL)?

Once the price traded away from NDOG right after opening, take initial ST liquidity, then cross NDOG to the opposite
side, also take ST liquidity, and it crosses back into NDOG... Once it does that, we have now set initial liquidity pool
for Buyside and Sellside. Now we're gonna wait. What we are waiting for? Time. We are waiting for Asia session at 7pm.

If ahead of 7 pm, the market moved towards upper, did displacement and/or retested NDOG, we can expect some small
retracement lower, maybe touch NDOG and to challenge old highs, ST Buyside liquidity, ITH, rel.eq.H, etc... 

This is a guide of "How to trade Asia?" every single day. If we cannot see these signatures, then we don't trade.
Algorithm should show us sell-program and/or buy-program right at 7mp or a little bit later, but we only interested
until 9pm, because it's our Asian session.

Even if we're not going to trade Asia, it's beneficial to log that in our journal. Because we gonna see these things,
which will further prove that the market is algorithmic. And it operates at a specific time of day. Every day...

If we kind of go higher and make higher highs and lows, and if we have BiSi with displacement, big green candle,
then the market is tipping his hand and proving us that it's not interesting to go lower. So because it's doing big
green BiSi, we would not expect price comes back into it. It should be a Breakaway Gap.

It doesn't mean that we should trade Asia, but it's the same thing when we trade NY.am session and studying price on
pre-market at 7am.

Where should market price go?
We're sitting and looking where is inefficiency (NDOGs and NWOGs, if we in discount and the market is below, then we
expect the price to go higher)

iFVG is when the market created FVG and rallies up into significant level, then we can expect that price will come back
and go down throw that FVG which will make it iFVG

### ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #3 August 7, 2024

At 7am, 8am or 9am we're sitting, relaxing and observing.
We don't care what happened in the previous session or trading day yet.
We want to see the design and engineering of
the liquidity. What does that mean? When price creates these smooth relative equals lows / highs after the session
changeover:
* At midnight NY local time, that's the beginning of a real true day in financial markets, so the algorithm likes to
  refer back to that time.
  And then everything since that time will be referred in the purposes of liquidity and inefficiency
* We have NWOG or NDOG.

Mark NDOG (H, L, and C.E.) It's where the market stopped trade yesterday at 5pm and started trade yesterday at 6pm.
The NDOG is influential up to 5 trading days.
The older NDOG, the lower influence it will have.

The Mark NWOG (H, L, and C.E.) It's where the market stopped trade on Fri at 5pm and started trade on Sun at 6pm.
NWOG is influential up to 5 trading weeks.
The older NWOG, the lower influence it will have.

if NDOG or NWOG is lacking one of any sides of delivery (Sellside or Buyside), then later market will react on these
levels.

If there is no data in NYam, try to trade NYpm session.
In this case, be in front of the charts at 13:30 to wait NYpm SB at 14:00.
If nothing is happened, then we wait for 15:00

First, our task is study price action, collect old data and journaling.
Next, stage is tape read and assume what price can do.
Next, we can start do entries and executions to lost feeling that we can do wrong entry.

Tomorrow (2024-08-08) ICT is 52.

### ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #2 August 6, 2024
[ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #2 August 6, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkI4AgC4OPI&ab_channel=TheInnerCircleTrader)

We start mark relative-equal highs / lows only after 7:00

FVG should be marked together with VI

High-probability rel.eq.highs are: left high one is lower than right high.

Breaker idea: waiting for stop run and then back into the range and then retrace to Breaker
iFVG: the highest form of precession, if we have a Gap post 7:00 that runs after rel.eq.H has been taken and makes a new
high after a long prior run in London. It might be a reversal. If there was a stop run and Breaker and FVG was form,
then we can use Model 2022, OTE and Breaker trade, but most important is to trade internal FVG in Breaker if it's
available!

The very first FVG prior to stop run (reversal) because it's a change in the state of delivery.
If there is no that FVG, then we are trading Breaker.

After reversal, we focus only on SiBis unless a direction won't be changed.

We are mark every single short-term high as well, because there are stops sitting.
Every FVG

At 7:00 we start a hunt, and if we see shark and jagged price action, then it probably will go opposite.

We are never annotate our charts in negative manner.

If in the first 30 minutes after 7:00 / 8:00 / 9:00 there are some rel.eq.H was form when market moving in the opposite
direction, then we want to see if market will drop. If there are rel.eq.L, then we want to see that market to go higher
after these 30 minutes

After 7:00 if we have stop runs H, we take a fib from that H to the low of the first candle at 7:00 to measure STDVs.
Same for 8:00 and 9:00

### ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #1 August 5, 2024
[ICT 2024 Mentorship \ Lecture #1 August 5, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKeLVR3dPuI&list=PLVgHx4Z63paaM41aubnHOmqfeNjSAoBCV&index=1&ab_channel=TheInnerCircleTrader)

Time is the most important part.

Our Task: studying price at specific time of the day

At 7:00-7:30 EST,
At 8:00-8:30 EST,
At 9:00-9:30 EST, prior to the NY Open:

* we are already on front of the charts
* we are looking at where highs and lows are
* we are looking at 3 timeframes: 15m => 5m => 1m
    * 15m: where is the market is smooth => liquidity levels and inefficiencies
    * 5m: where is the market is smooth => liquidity levels and inefficiencies
    * 1m: where is the market is smooth => liquidity levels and inefficiencies
* when we see market structure shift and  anticipating price run above short-term low, we do measure, because we have
  zero-baseline exp., and we do journal:
    * record how long that price run is taken (for example, how many 1m candles)
    * record or screenshot honestly, what it felt for us physically (anxiety, impatient, excited, etc...)
* we should trade only one micro contract, at least 1 year of studying... we can start thinking of pyramiding, but we
  can't do pyramiding at least 1 year! This is how we study ICT. This is the only thing we can do to remove greed and
  fear. We can't blow the account by trading one micro contract and we only take one trade a day

Every single-day algorithm will always do this: run on liquidity (orders sitting inside inefficiencies, or above old
highs or below old lows) where the market needs to offer fair value to the marketplace.
Once we know that market is likely to do these things (run on liquidity or inside inefficiencies), that's an algorithmic
characteristic.

So we want to daily bias, and we want to trade that: buy below the open and hold for the whole the entire day.
And it's really hard, because we start thinking about securing our profitable trade, so patience and waiting became the
hardest wrestling match...
But the reason why we so stress about it, is because we don't know what we are doing. We haven't done that waiting part
long enough, where we completely desensitized to get comfortable with and anticipating price moves and get comfortable
with to not knowing what it's going to do next (this candle, next candle, five candles from now and so on...) but when
we are thinking that its going to draw on to this specific price levels, we have marked on 8:00-8:30

As soon as we pushed the button, we've entered the jungle; yours is mine or mine is yours. Are we a liquidity? If we are
a liquidity, we are the lunch. We should go in, and we are looking for lunch, for liquidity, we are looking that market
can go into specified levels at 8:00-8:30 EST. It can draw on Liquidity in directional movement. It may not draw on that
liquidity, but the market is probably going to move until it hits that level. It doesn't mean that it can't have
a replacement lower or it doesn't mean that it can't make a lower low (new low of the day), highly unlikely but not
impossible.

Anyway, we should still have an initial idea and follow the rules. So when we are first trying to learn how to read
these markets and when we are first trying to determen where the market is likely to go... We have to strip away
everything that we're trying to force into reading every single individual candlestick

So when we are looking at the price, as new students we should approach it kind of the game and a discovery, something
fun. Not a video game, but its game of determining does it have what it takes to move to those highs? A way of saying to
yourself that it's very disarming. Okay, like: I see how this is smooth, - these two highs are relatively-equal... That
looks like a really nice obvious flat space in price. If on opposite site we don't see same flatness, then it may have
some meaning for us.

The market will go in area of smoothness for the purpose of run on liquidity and pair any orders will sitting above old
or relative equal highs or below old or relative equal lows...

What is smooth? For example, relative-equal swing highs...
When we are looking for a relative-equal highs, how do we know that it's a high probability likely to swept or traded
throw highs? When we have two swing highs and one to the left is slightly higher than one to the right, then it's a
very-very high-probability that we are going to take it above.
This is called priming. Priming is when with manipulation we create low resistance liquidity, but retail thinks that
this is a resistance. So later market and smart money can rip them all. We want to be on smart money side at that time.
When smart money do manipulation they are creating a sympathetic side (all short sellers retail crowd can relax at this
moment and put their buy stops above these relative-equal highs)

When is relative-equal low going to be swept? When after lower relative-equal high prior to draw on liquidity, a higher
low was created.

Now let's talk about a time. Because all these things are going to repeat every single day at specific periods of
time...
Every day between 8:00 and 8:30, we sitting in fron of charts and trying to define where the smooth locations in price
action on
* 15m
* 5m
* 1m

Real important note: It does not mean that this run on liquidity is having to happen during that exact session!
And that is the underlying risk we're managing every time we take into trade.

Pre-market range: 7:00-7:30 EST
Opening range is 7:30-8:00 EST

Pre-market range: 8:00-8:30 EST
Opening range is 8:30-9 :00 EST

Pre-market range: 9:00-9:30 EST
Opening range is 9:30-10:00 EST

Prior to pre-market ranges we are looking for relative-equal highs or relative-equal lows. Which side has it? Because
that's our bias, it's going to draw on that...

How do we know if we have both sides relative-equal lows and highs? We wait for draw on first and get disrupted...
Because once that happens then we work to the other. That's our bias! So we have to defer and wait

### Keynotes & Observations - May 01, 2024
[Keynotes & Observations - May 01, 2024]()

In FOMC day is 2 stage event: 1) Move start on 14:00 and complete at 14:30 2) At 14:35
I can do either reversal or continue

Non-Farm Payroll is also nopt possible for trading - algorithm is turn off and manual
intervention will be turned on

How to detect time when LRL in place? If there are no news drivers.

Session bias can be built for 4h and 1h charts: were we are? where are we going from?
where are we going to (block, inefficiency, C.E, draw on liquidity etc...)?

Why we don't want Opening Range Gap fill completely if we are Bearish? Because if it
cannot fill that Gap it means that it Very Bearish.

We can expect as retail traders want to go short after big down day, so smart money
wants to trap them. Takeaway from this is: when retail public crowd want to sell,
smart money want to move markets higher to get everybody else Byu stops.

### Reading Price Without A Bias - April 30, 2024
[Reading Price Without A Bias - April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joqM_Z96vtM)

Do not trade on non-farm payroll week from after lunch Wed till Fri.
If we want we can trade 15-30 minutes after non-farm payroll numbers report.

Reclaimed FVG / Reclaimed OB is when initial expectations is used at later time.
IFGV / Mitigation block is when its reverse the role.

Bounce price range is when you have 2 inefficiencies (BiSi and SiBi) in opposing
directions in a same general area in terms of price. Best is with 1 candle in a
middle because it would be sudden and more impactful. Or it could be pattern called
island reversal. We can trade is as iFVG

[How To Read Price With Or Without A Bias - April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpdFdIckXqo)

Wicks == Gaps. Our focus on C.E. or upper quadrants if bullish (lower quadrants when bearish).

When we have high impact news, we are wait for damage and manipulation. Only then, after all retail
traders will be stopped out from their seats we are looking for turtle sups or other setups.

If there are no high impact news, then we can relay on macros (every single trading hour 20 minutes
macros): 9:50am-10:10am, 10:50am-11:10am, 1:50pm-2:10pm, 2:50pm-3:10pm and 3:15-3:45 last hour macro

If bullish and want to use +OB, then there should be only few down closed candles that we should use
only as opportunity to buy. If there are a lot of down closed candles, then we either on
consolidation or near to high, but definitely not in up move.

Same thing in relation to FVG, we don't want to see every FVG was fully rebalanced, we do want to
see price left some inefficiency stay opened, not fully closed, otherwise we maybe on end of the run

To capture nice day trades we need to look at 15m charts or 1h charts.
To capture nice swing trades we need to look at 1h charts or 4h charts.
To capture nice position trades we need to look at 1D charts or 1W charts.

Change in a state of delivery it's always opening price of OB. Delivery it's
directional price run, so it's going to be a change in the direction of price.

Bias must be found based on weekly and daily charts.
Don't build bias based on anything what less than 1 hour.

SM doing stop runs only to kick out everyone who can be profitable and
to catch traders who created limit orders for breakouts.

Seasonal tendency take price down into the spring decline.

In days when we have high impacted news we should use 5 minutes
timeframe to reduce choppiness and spottiness of price fluctuation.
In all other "normal" trading days we can use 1 minute and sub-minute
timeframes.
On high impact news drivers we should wait and use 5 minutes charts at
least 15-20-30 minutes and only then we can start dropping down below
5 minutes charts for looking for inefficiencies because we won't
probably pick a right one...

When I'm bullish, my stop loss should have 3 PD arrays above it or
3 PD arrays below it when I'm bearish.

Dealer range is high that was engaged buyside and low that was engaged sellside.
And it must be on a timeframe we are looking for analysis (5 minutes on high
impact driver news during 15-30 minutes after release). Best moves starts from \
running stops, so if we are bearish - we want to see that market take buy stops
first.

Algorithm is designed to range wide to seek liquidity.

Important to keep in mind quadrants and remember that best entries when we are:
* bullish: in between 50%-100% of +OB or +FVG
