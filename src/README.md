            because all posts here are pretty much specific...
            But if you like it - welcome! ‚úåÔ∏è

  details: As you might know I'm doing software engineering.
            During my career I worked with many people, customers and companies.
            I've experience with many different programming languages, platforms and tools.
            I learned a lot already and I know that tomorrow I will learn more!
            This area is growing fast! So we must develop ourselves
            today unless we want to be a dinosaur tomorrow...
