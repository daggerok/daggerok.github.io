# ICT
This is my ICT notes. I started learn it this (2023) year, but topic is quite big and complex, so I feel
that I should make some notes about it

## [Seasonality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmeCWULSTHc&t=26s)
* Weekly bias. [On a weekly chart (preferably before week start) we should think of where weekly candle should go
  higher or lower](https://youtu.be/tmeCWULSTHc?si=Fs4jFaHgYEBTnhH1&t=983). It depends on FED how ots gonna rase
  interrest rate (Stock markets doesn't like that). If we are in a earching season, then there are a lot of
  valotility because of earnings. All this factors - are drivers to where is market is going to go, up or down to
  drawing a liquidity or deliver price effectively to some previously formed FVG. So the only thing we are looking
  for is a likly movement higher or lower based on a weekly candle
* Daily bias. [On a daily chart we are lookling for swing highs and swing lows to get your liquidity
  ](https://youtu.be/tmeCWULSTHc?si=HZNXc0wvjaIxyMHE&t=995). Major treading time to looking for reasons what makes
  market go higher or lower will be found on that TF (time frame). We wanna see every STL (short teram low) which
  is going to be a sell stops on a bearish bias or buy stops on a bulish bias. Market is always drawing one of
  these things:
  - its drawing to stops, which is liquidity, or
  - its running to [imbalance (FVG)](https://youtu.be/tmeCWULSTHc?si=ObTgBNA4WAAsjBCW&t=1064)

## Rules

* Before trade always check highs and lows marker could sweep above or below for **Stop Raid**:
  * Asian session in between 7pm-9pm
  * London session in between 2am-5am
  * New York session in between 7am-10am
  * And finally intrady just before 9:30am 
* Trade from Monday till Friday:
  * From 8:30am (or 9:30am depends on year time) till 12pm
  * From 1-1:30pm till 4-4:30pm
* Do not trade on Thursday and Friday in between 8am and 10am
* **FVG** with **OTE** is signifficant only if before it we traded into Sellside Liquidity or Buyside Liquidity meaning
  that is should be traded under Retail Trader idea of support level / double bottom or it should be traded above Retail
  trader idea of resistance level / double top / head and sholders, etc... 
* Every gap or inefficiency should delivered (filled) with both up and down price actions. So if Buyside delivery (when
  marked goes up) occurred it reasonable expect that later Sellside delivery is also going to be done eventually
* In most cases in 8:30am when news are came out the first run whatever that direction is in price that is the fake
  move - that is a first stage delivery. The second stage is the opposite is whatever that is meaning we will see price
  do reversal.
  For example:
  
  ![Fake move on MNQZ2023 on Fri Oct 06 '23 at 8:30am](./MNQZ2023-Fri-Oct-06-at-8-30-am-1st-stage.png)
  Here everybody thinking: "okay, it's gonna go lower" and it's crashes everyone that's already in long... And it did so
  in stunning fashion very quickly, which scares everyone in a marketplace, it terrifies them! ...Then the market does
  a second stage: what the 8:30am news sentiment shift caused everyone to think that it would keep going lower and keep
  going lower... They trapped them short and then they run against the move that took place in the morning:
