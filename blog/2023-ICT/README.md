# ICT
This is my ICT notes. I started learn it this (2023) year, but topic is quite big and complex, so I feel
that I should make some notes about it

## Learnng Plan
* ICT 2022 Mentorship
* ICT Silve Bullet

## When professionals trade?
* Do not trade on Wensday, Thoursday and Friday leading up to Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) because ther are is going to be a lot of volatility 
* Monday and Tuesday
* Wensday will have big price move if on Tue price was consolidate

## [Seasonality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmeCWULSTHc&t=26s)
* **SMT Divergence** (Smart Money Technique Divergence) is showing a willingness to correct the correlation.
  Usually it happens
  - At 8:30
  - At 9:30
  - At news events beign released
  And if we have a bias then it's healpful: For example **we are bulish** and **NASDAQ did a lower low**
  but **E-MINI S&P 500 - a higher low**, then we shouldn't trade **NASDAQ**, but **S&P 500** because its not
  likely to go lower, but higher
* On a **daily timeframe** charts we are looking for **SMT divergence** between all these 3 Indexes:
  - NASDAQ
  - S&P 500
  - DOW
* **In spring in between Apr and May** we are looking for **Bearish SMT divergence** when one of these indexes
  will not be able to form higher high.
  Once that happened we are hunt for **ICT 2022 Mentorship Bearish Model**
* **In autumn (fall) in between 3rd week of Spe and 3rd week of Nov** we are looking for
  **Billush SMT divergence** when one of these indexes will not be able to form lower low.
  Once that happened we are hunt for **ICT 2022 Mentorship Bullish Model**
* Weekly bias. [On a weekly chart (preferably before week start) we should think of where weekly candle should go
  higher or lower](https://youtu.be/tmeCWULSTHc?si=Fs4jFaHgYEBTnhH1&t=983). It depends on FED how ots gonna rase
  interrest rate (Stock markets doesn't like that). If we are in a earching season, then there are a lot of
  valotility because of earnings. All this factors - are drivers to where is market is going to go, up or down to
  drawing a liquidity or deliver price effectively to some previously formed FVG. So the only thing we are looking
  for is a likly movement higher or lower based on a weekly candle
* Daily bias. [On a daily chart we are lookling for swing highs and swing lows to get your liquidity
  ](https://youtu.be/tmeCWULSTHc?si=HZNXc0wvjaIxyMHE&t=995). Major treading time to looking for reasons what makes
  market go higher or lower will be found on that TF (time frame). We wanna see every STL (short teram low) which
  is going to be a sell stops on a bearish bias or buy stops on a bulish bias. Market is always drawing one of
  these things:
  - its drawing to stops, which is liquidity, or
  - its running to [imbalance (FVG)](https://youtu.be/tmeCWULSTHc?si=ObTgBNA4WAAsjBCW&t=1064)

  be changed in a moment where market price is opened at 9:30am... If current price is opened above

* **Old High** or **Old Low** is a first nearest Swing High or Swing Low you can found going back on a chart starting
  from current candle. If there are any other importants like **Fair Value Gap** or **Volume Gap** on a chart exists
  near that Old High / Old Low, then we should watch our trade range in between that and current candles highs and lows
  current candle and candle with
* **Silver Bullet** (SB). 1-hour time interval where a **FVG** can be touched: 10am-11am, 1pm-2pm

  move in the end of the day. If you don't have a setup by 10 minutes to 4 then don't do anything. Usually setup should appear
  in between 15:15-15:45 little tiny small sweet spot where I'm looking for liquidity (above the marketplace if I'm bulish or
  below marketplace if I'm bearish) or if there is an imbalance (BISI if I'm bulish, SIBI if I'm bearish)

## Rules
* Before trade always check highs and lows marker could sweep above or below for **Stop Raid**:
  * Asian session in between 7pm-9pm
  * London session in between 2am-5am
  * New York session in between 7am-10am
  * And finally intrady just before 9:30am 
* Trade from Monday till Friday:
  * From 8:30am (or 9:30am depends on year time) till 12pm
  * From 1-1:30pm till 4-4:30pm
* Do not trade on Thursday and Friday in between 8am and 10am
* **FVG** with **OTE** is signifficant only if before it we traded into Sellside Liquidity or Buyside Liquidity meaning
  that is should be traded under Retail Trader idea of support level / double bottom or it should be traded above Retail
  trader idea of resistance level / double top / head and sholders, etc... 
* Every gap or inefficiency should delivered (filled) with both up and down price actions. So if Buyside delivery (when
  marked goes up) occurred it reasonable expect that later Sellside delivery is also going to be done eventually
* In most cases in 8:30am when news are came out the first run whatever that direction is in price that is the fake
  move - that is a first stage delivery. The second stage is the opposite is whatever that is meaning we will see price
  do reversal.
  For example:
  
  ![Fake move on MNQZ2023 on Fri Oct 06 '23 at 8:30am](./MNQZ2023-Fri-Oct-06-at-8-30-am-1st-stage.png)
  Here everybody thinking: "okay, it's gonna go lower" and it's crashes everyone that's already in long... And it did so
  in stunning fashion very quickly, which scares everyone in a marketplace, it terrifies them! ...Then the market does
  a second stage: what the 8:30am news sentiment shift caused everyone to think that it would keep going lower and keep
  going lower... They trapped them short and then they run against the move that took place in the morning:
